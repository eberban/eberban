eberban
=========

**eberban** is a [Lojban](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban)-inspired [constructed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) aimed at being simple, regular and
expressive.

- Simple: eberban is made entirely out of predicates, which are manipulated with
  particles, following relatively few yet composable grammar rules.
- Regular: particles are organized into families, each with a unique prefix, enabling
  quick recognition and accelerating learning.
- Expressive: predicates can be combined in a variety of ways to add more details, greatly
  increasing the expressive power of the language.

<!-- TODO: [jqueiroz] explicitly mention chaining -->

> From a lojbanist perspective: it aims at merging brivla and rafsi (by having
> all predicate words follow a carefully designed pattern of coda consonants, non-coda consonants and vowels/apostrophes; [more details](https://mia-entropy.github.io/eberban/books/tour/book/morphology.html)).
> Following a suggestion by la uakci, it also removes sumti from the grammar and
> works only with predicates themselves.
