<p><strong>Eberban</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineered_language#Logical_languages">logical</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">constructed language</a> aimed to satisfy the
following goals :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>being simple :</strong> the Eberban grammar allows manipulating predicates with
particles in a way that is close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_logic">higher-order logic</a> it translates
into, while abstracting away the verbosity of explicitly providing variables
as arguments of predicates.</li>
<li><strong>being regular :</strong> valid sentences are syntactically unambiguous. Most
grammar rules rely on particles which are organised into families, each
starting with a unique prefix. Many additional patterns are shared between
particles and predicate words to help with learning groups of related words.</li>
<li><strong>being expressive :</strong> the grammar and core vocabulary focus on providing a
simple framework, on top of which can be built abstractions, complex concepts
and tools. Since those are built into Eberban itself, users can create their
own tools and abstractions to express entirely new concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eberban</strong> takes inspiration from <a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban">Lojban</a> and other logical languages, but
tries novel approaches to satisfy the above goals.</p>
<p>Most resources are hosted on <a href="https://eberban.github.io/eberban/">GitHub pages</a>, such as :</p>
<ul>
<li>parsers, which transform text into a tree structure, that can also be
visualized as nested boxes.</li>
<li>a dictionary to search words and their definitions.</li>
<li>learning resources to discover the language grammar and concepts.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="morphology"><a class="header" href="#morphology">Morphology</a></h1>
<p>The morphology of Eberban is composed of 16 consonants (<strong>n, r, l, m, p, b, f, v, t, d, s, z, c, j,
g, k</strong>), five vowels (<strong>i, e, a, o, u</strong>) the letter <strong>h</strong>, the hyphen <strong>-</strong> and the quotation marks
<strong>[</strong> and <strong>]</strong>, for a total of 25 symbols. Among the consonants, <strong>n</strong>, <strong>r</strong> and <strong>l</strong> are
designated as (alveolar) <strong>sonorants</strong>, and play an important role in Eberban’s morphology. The
alphabetical order is <code>hnrlmpbfvtdszcjkgieaou</code>. The same letter appearing multiple times in a row is
considered identical to the letter not being repeated, but can informally be used in written media
to convey length of sounds in speech. Any other character is considered a space, and quotation marks
are also considered a space outside of foreign quotes syntax (explained later).</p>
<p>Strings of multiple vowels and <strong>h</strong> appear a lot in Eberban’s morphology, and thus are coined
<strong>vhowels</strong> in this book. Note that in <strong>vhowels</strong>, <strong>h</strong> can only appear between two vowels.</p>
<p>Words are usually written separated by spaces, however this is not mandatory. Spaces are only
mandatory before words starting with a <strong>vowel</strong> or a <strong>sonorant</strong>.</p>
<p>Eberban text is usually written all lowercase (outside of foreign text quotes), but uppercase can
informally be used in written media to convey volume (such as yelling). No punctuation symbol is
used but informally punctuation from other languages can be used as long as the proper Eberban
grammar is also used. <code>.</code> is commonly used to visually join two words that must have space between
them, while one or many <code>.</code> surrounded by spaces usually convey a longer pause in speach. Hyphen can
be used at syllable boundary to make them stand-out without breaking the word in two, and also allows
a word to continue on the next line.</p>
<h2 id="word-types"><a class="header" href="#word-types">Word types</a></h2>
<h3 id="particles"><a class="header" href="#particles">Particles</a></h3>
<p><strong>Particles</strong> are words exerting grammatical functions. They can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>start with a single <em>non-sonorant consonant</em>, followed only by <em>vhowels</em>, like <strong>zi</strong>,
<strong>mio</strong> or <strong>tiho</strong>.</li>
<li>start with a <em>sonorant</em> or <em>vowels</em>, and be a string of <em>vhowels</em> and <em>sonorants</em>. They can end
either with a <em>vowel</em> or <em>sonorant</em>. Exemples: <strong>a</strong>, <strong>on</strong>, <strong>ahu</strong> or <strong>nu</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Particles are themselves categorized into <strong>families</strong> having identical grammar
but different meanings. Those families are usually designated using a particle in capital letters
(like <strong>MI</strong> or <strong>VEI</strong>), which is by convention the first particle in this family in alphabetical
order.</p>
<p>All other words are <strong>predicate words</strong> and express intrinsic meanings, such as “cat”, “language” or
“teach”. They are grouped into the following categories :</p>
<h3 id="roots"><a class="header" href="#roots">Roots</a></h3>
<p><strong>Roots</strong> are the building blocks of the language and express meanings that would be hard or too
long to convey otherwise. They can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>start with a single <em>non-sonorant consonant</em> followed by a mix of <em>vhowels</em> and at least one
<em>sonorant</em>, <em>medial consonant pair</em> or <em>consonant triplet</em>, like <strong>ban</strong>, <strong>mana</strong>, <strong>cuina</strong> or
<strong>marne</strong>.</li>
<li>start with a valid <em>initial consonant pair</em> followed by a mix of <em>vhowels</em> and any number of
<em>sonorants</em>, <em>medial consonant pairs</em>  or <em>consonant triplet</em> (even none), like <strong>bju</strong>, <strong>cpena</strong>
or <strong>djin</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>consonant triplet</em> is a string of 3 consonants C1C2C3 such that C1C2 is a medial pair <strong>and</strong>
C2C3 is an initial pair.</p>
<p>A <em>sonorant</em> can appear only between two <em>vowels</em> or at the end of the root, while a medial pair or
consonant triplet can appear only between two <em>vowels</em>, but not at the end.</p>
<p>The following chart shows <strong>initial pairs</strong> in light blue, <strong>medial pairs</strong> in pink, and invalid
pairs in dark gray (with a short explanation for why they are invalid):</p>
<p><img src="morphonology/chart-pairs.png" alt="Chart of valid initial and medial pairs" /></p>
<h3 id="borrowings"><a class="header" href="#borrowings">Borrowings</a></h3>
<p><strong>Borrowings</strong> allow importing foreign words or names. They are prefixed by the vowel <strong>u</strong>, and
have more relaxed rules about consonants than native Eberban words: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Initial pairs</em> can also appear in the middle of the word.</li>
<li><em>Medial pairs</em> can also appear initially as they can be easily uttered after borrowing prefix
<strong>u</strong></li>
<li><em>Sonorant</em> + <em>consonant</em> also counts as a consonant pair and doesn’t break into 2 words.</li>
<li><em>Sonorant</em> + <em>initial pair</em> also counts as a consonant triplet and doesn’t break into 2 words.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the <strong>u</strong>  prefix the borrowing can start by a vowel, a single consonant, a initial or medial
consonant pair, a consonant triplet or <strong>h</strong>. If this first letter is a <strong>u</strong> it must be prefixed
with a <strong>’</strong> to separate it from the the prefix.</p>
<p>Borrowings must end with a <em>vowel</em>, or a <em>vowel</em> followed by a single <em>consonant</em> (not only
<em>sonorants</em>). In written media, borrowings must be followed by space(s), which is realized in speech
by pausing after the borrowing to properly separate it from the following word.</p>
<p>Similarly, the initial <strong>u</strong> must be preceded by space(s), and realized orally as either a pause or
a glottal stop.</p>
<h3 id="freeform-variables"><a class="header" href="#freeform-variables">Freeform variables</a></h3>
<p><strong>Freeform variables</strong> allow speakers to define their own predicates with less morphological
restrictions than with roots or dedicated particles. They follow the same morphology as <em>borrowings</em>
but use the <strong>i</strong> prefix instead of <strong>u</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="compounds"><a class="header" href="#compounds">Compounds</a></h3>
<p><strong>Compounds</strong> allow making new words from multiple other kind of words. They start with either
<strong>e</strong>, <strong>en</strong> or <strong>er</strong> and follow the same rule as the <strong>u</strong> of borrowings. Their structure will be
detailed <a href="morphonology/../grammar/compounds.html">later in this book</a>.</p>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h3>
<p>With spaces : <em>a za ualis zue gali spie ebansa eberban</em><br />
With mandatory spaces only : <em>aza.ualis.zuegalispie.ebansa.eberban</em><br />
Meaning: Alice is happy to speak in Eberban.</p>
<p>Particles : <em>a</em>, <em>za</em>, <em>zue</em><br />
Borrowing : <em>ualis</em><br />
Freeform variable: <em>ibar</em> (not present in exemple)<br />
Root : <em>gali</em>, <em>spie</em><br />
Compounds : <em>ebansa</em>, <em>eberban</em></p>
<h3 id="reasoning"><a class="header" href="#reasoning">Reasoning</a></h3>
<p>Outside of borrowings and assignable names, encountering a <em>non-sonorant consonant</em> or a pause means
it is the end of a word; unless it the first letter of a <em>medial consonant pair</em> which cannot be
misunderstood for the start of a new word. Spaces prevent words starting with a <em>vowel</em> or
<em>sonorant</em> to “merge” into the previous words.</p>
<p>These simple rules prevent any ambiguity of word boundaries, which is called a <strong>Self-Segregating
Morphology</strong>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="logic-framework"><a class="header" href="#logic-framework">Logic framework</a></h1>
<p>Eberban is based on a custom <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_logic">Higher-order Logic (HOL)</a></strong> and tries to stay
pretty close to expressions in such logic while being targeted for human speech.</p>
<p>Eberban grammar allows the speaker to manipulate <strong>predicates</strong>. They are
functions that take <strong>arguments</strong> as input and output a <strong>truth value</strong> which
can be <strong>true</strong>, <strong>false</strong> or <strong>unknown/undefined</strong>. They are introduced by
<strong>predicate words</strong> or created from other predicates using Eberban grammar.</p>
<p>Arguments are not filled using <strong>predicate words</strong> directly and there is no
word that directly represents them. Instead some <strong>particles</strong> allow the speaker
to select which arguments are going to be used for various operations on 
<strong>predicates</strong>, such as connecting them with each other. Arguments are typed, 
and can either represent <strong>predicates</strong> or non-predicates which are called
<strong>atoms</strong>.</p>
<p>The first of these arguments is handled automatically by the grammar and is
called the <strong>context argument</strong>. It is used to carry information between
predicates without verbosity for speakers to implement things, such as tenses.</p>
<p>Other arguments are represented using the vowels <strong>e, a, o, u</strong> in this order.
They are used in definitions but also in some families of particles related to
argument selection. They are called <strong>explicit arguments</strong> (to exclude the
<em>implicit</em> context argument), and we call <strong>arity</strong> (N-ary) the number of
<strong>explicit arguments</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is an exemple of a simple predicate :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mian</strong></p>
<p>\[ \text{mian}(c,e) = \text{[$e$ is a cat in context $c$]} \]</p>
<p>Given $(c), $(e):<br />
$(e) is a cat in context $(c).</p>
<p>$(c) and $(e) are arguments that will be provided when used in a sentence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In future explanations we’ll omit the context argument outside of logical
notation to be shorter, unless the context argument is the focus of the
explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any <strong>predicate word</strong> not yet defined in the dictionnary or by the speaker
return <strong>unknown/undefined</strong> for any arguments.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chaining"><a class="header" href="#chaining">Chaining</a></h1>
<p>When two predicates are strung one after the other they form a new predicate,
which has the same arguments as the left predicate.</p>
<p>Every predicate has a default <strong>chaining behavior</strong> which dictates how two
predicates are connected together. If the left predicate has <strong>intransitive
behavior</strong>, then its <strong>E</strong> place will interact with the right predicate.
Otherwise if the left predicate has <strong>transitive behavior</strong>, then the <strong>A</strong>
place is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For <strong>root words</strong>, they have <strong>transitive behavior</strong> if they end with a
<strong>vowel</strong>, while they have <strong>intransitive behavior</strong> if they end with <strong>n, r
or l</strong>.</p>
<p>This place can expect either an atom/generic, or a predicate. As this can
greatly impact the structure of sentences, this is encoded in <strong>root words</strong>
with the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the root is a form <strong>CCV</strong>, the A place is a predicate place.</li>
<li>if the root ends with an <strong>-i</strong>, the A place is a predicate place.</li>
<li>otherwise the place is an atom/generic place.</li>
<li>an intransitive root shouldn’t have a E predicate place, as it will be chained
to as if it was an atom/generic place. If a predicate have a
single predicate place, it should be transitive with a single A predicate place.
A predicate with many predicate places can have a E predicate place but it
must be transitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Particles acting as predicates have different rules which will be explained
later.</p>
<p>When chaining predicates the new predicate inherits the <strong>chaining behavior</strong>
of the left predicate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="atom-argument-chaining"><a class="header" href="#atom-argument-chaining">Atom argument chaining</a></h2>
<p>If the chaining argument is an <strong>atom</strong> argument, then the variable filling this
argument also fills the <strong>E</strong> argument of the right predicate. The
<strong>context argument</strong> is automatically shared between left and right predicates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mian blan</strong></p>
<p>\[ \begin{align}
\text{mian}(c,e)   &amp;= \text{[$e$ is a cat]} \\
\text{blan}(c,e)   &amp;= \text{[$e$ is beautiful]} \\

\end{align} \]</p>
<p>Given $(c),$(e):<br />
$(e) is a cat and is beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the right predicate has more than one explicit argument, then it is wrapped
in a predicate having only one explicit argument and every other argument is
filled with <strong>existential variables</strong>. The process of wrapping the predicate and
creating <strong>existential variables</strong> to have the correct arity is called
<strong>arity mismatch resolution</strong> and it is a key aspect of Eberban grammar to
reduce verbosity in simple cases.</p>

<p>If the chaining argument is a <strong>predicate argument</strong>, then the right predicate

with any (correctly typed) arguments, and with a different <em>context argument</em>.</p>

<p>When the speaker wants to interact with an argument that normal chaining doesn’t
select (due to transitivity, or because they want to interact with O or U
arguments), it is possible to attach additional bindings using the <strong>VI</strong> family
of particles after a predicate, followed by another (chain of) predicate(s),
which is closed by the <strong>vei</strong> particle to return to the previously seen
chaining behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>vei</strong> is the only member of family <strong>VEI</strong>, and not a member of <strong>VI</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ve, va, vo, vu</strong> allow binding atom (or generic) arguments :</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To bind more than one argument of the same predicate we have to use the <strong>FI</strong>
family, which interacts with the same predicate as the last non-closed <strong>VI</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>FI</strong> family follows the same pattern of vowels as <strong>VI</strong>.
The above sentence can thus be rewritten as <code>duna [ve mi, fo mo vei] meon</code> or
even as <code>duna [ve mi, fo mo, fa meon vei]</code>. <strong>FI</strong> have additional members:
<strong>feu</strong> to bind the same place as the previous <strong>FI</strong> or <strong>VI</strong> in the chain,
while <strong>fau</strong> binds the next place (this allows bind places of a predicate
having more than 4 slots, which should however be rare).</p>
<p>In the last exemple it is possible to omit the final <strong>vei</strong>. It is, however,
not possible to do so in the previous exemples as we would get the chain
<code>mo meon</code> which is not what we want.</p>
<h2 id="arguments-list"><a class="header" href="#arguments-list">Arguments list</a></h2>
<p>Between <strong>VI/FI</strong> and the inner predicate an <strong>arguments list</strong> can be provided
by having zero or more <strong>KI/GI/BA</strong> terminated with <strong>be</strong>, in which case the
bindings will occur with those arguments instead of the arguments of the
predicate after <strong>be</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>KI</strong> (all particles starting with <em>k-</em>) represent an atom or generic argument
$(x) and have meaning \(ki(c,e) = [\text{$e$ is variable $x$}]\).</p>
<p><strong>GI</strong> (all particles starting with <em>g-</em>), however, represents a predicate whose
arity and type will be inferred from its usage in the sentence. All <strong>GI</strong>
starting with <strong>gi-</strong> have <strong>intransitive sharing behavior</strong>, while the others starting
with <strong>ge/ga/go/gu-</strong> have <strong>transitive behavior</strong>. For transitive <strong>GI</strong>,
chaining to a <strong>GI</strong> ending with <strong>-i</strong> will be done <strong>by equivalence</strong>, otherwise
by <strong>sharing</strong> (like the final <strong>-i</strong> rule for roots).</p>
<p>Any <strong>BA</strong> used in the argument list allow skipping this argument if it is not
used in the inner predicate. Which <strong>BA</strong> member is used doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><strong>BA</strong> can also be used outside of the argument list, which adds an argument at
the end of the list and uses it directly. <strong>ba</strong> declares an atom/generic
argument (like a KI), <strong>bahi</strong> a transitivite predicate argument (like a
gi-initial GI), and <strong>bahe</strong> an intransitive predicate argument (like a non
gi-initial GI). <strong>bai</strong>, <strong>baihi</strong> and <strong>baihe</strong> on the other hand always adds
an argument at the end of the <strong>sentence arguments list</strong>, which is mostly
useful when asking questions.</p>

<p>When it is only needed to bind one or two places of a predicate, using <strong>VI/FI</strong>
and multiple lists of multiple arguments quickly becomes verbose. For that
reason, predicates can be prefixed with particles of family <strong>SI</strong> (all
particles starting with <em>s-</em>), which override the chaining behavior.</p>
<p><strong>se, sa, so, su</strong> select the place corresponding to its vowel both for the
argument bound with a predicate on its right, and for the single argument that
is exposed in the combined predicate. The right place is bound by sharing, while
adding a final <strong>-i</strong> makes it bound by equivalence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mian se etiansa blan</strong></p>
<p>\[ \begin{align}

<p><strong>SI</strong> particles with two vowels (except <strong>i</strong>) allow to select both, the two
vowels representing the two exposed place, and the second vowel corresponding to
the slot bound with a predicate on its right. As with single vowel the right place
is bound by sharing, while adding a final <strong>-i</strong> makes it bound by equivalence.</p>

<p><strong>SI</strong> particles follow a more general pattern to support more slots and usages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>si</strong> followed by a single vowel makes the predicate “transparent” by
re-exposing all the places of the predicate on its right, which is bound to
the slot corresponding to the vowel used. This is mostly useful with predicates
having a proposition (0-ary) place, such that the predicates before and after
can be bound together “across” the predicate with the proposition place.</li>
<li>Otherwise, <strong>SI</strong> particles are composed of an <strong>s</strong> followed either by
one or many <strong>e/a/o/u</strong> or a single <strong>i</strong>, which can optionally be followed
by <strong>h</strong> followed by a single <strong>e/a/o/u</strong>. The one or many <strong>e/a/o/u</strong> lists
the slots of the predicate to expose, while a single <strong>i</strong> exposes none.
The <strong>h</strong> followed by a single <strong>e/a/o/u</strong> selects the slot bound with a
predicate on the right. When absent, the last <strong>e/a/o/u</strong> is used instead.
Final <strong>-i</strong> encodes if the place is bound with sharing or equivalence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Exemples :</p>
<ul>
<li>sia: Transparent A</li>
<li>sea: Expose E and A, chain to A with sharing</li>
<li>seho: Expose E only, chain to O with sharing</li>
<li>saeoi: Expose A, E and O (in this order), chain to O with equivalence.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="left-predicate-place-selection"><a class="header" href="#left-predicate-place-selection">Left predicate place selection</a></h2>
<p>Using <strong>ve, va, vo, vu</strong> on a predicate argument will not provide its
definition but instead share it like an atom argument with the following
predicate. The bound place must have the same predicate argument type however.
To provide a definition of the predicate argument the particles <strong>vie, via, vio,
viu</strong> (and <strong>FI</strong> equivalents) must be used. <strong>FI</strong> have again additional members:
<strong>fei</strong> to bind the same place as the previous <strong>FI</strong> or <strong>VI</strong> in the chain,
while <strong>fai</strong> binds the next place.</p>
<p>If we take the example <code>tce mian</code> from the previous chapter it is equivalent to
<code>tce via mian</code>. Sharing with <strong>ve, va, …</strong> can be used like so:</p>

<p><strong>pe</strong> and <strong>pei</strong> are like spoken brackets that wrap a predicate or chain of
predicates to define a new one, and have higher priority than chaining : <code>A B pe C D pei E F</code> will be chained in order <code>A (B ([C D] (E F)))</code> instead of <code>A (B (C (D (E F))))</code>. <strong>pe</strong> can also be followed by an argument list to define the
arguments of this new predicate.</p>
<p>Using <strong>VI/FI/SI</strong> is often preferred and more simple than using <strong>pe</strong> and
<strong>pei</strong>, but in some cases it is not possible. Those cases will be presented in

<p>Eberban sentences all start with particles in families <strong>A</strong>, <strong>O</strong> or <strong>NI</strong>, which are
respectively all particles which start with <strong>a-</strong>, <strong>o-</strong> and <strong>n-</strong>. They are followed by a
combination of these elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>definable word</strong>: a root, compound, <strong>GI</strong> and i-variable (optionally namespaced, see <strong>ohi</strong>
explanation below).</li>
<li>an <strong>inner predicate</strong>, which is a <strong>predicate chain</strong> optionally prefixed by an <strong>argument
list</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A</strong>, <strong>O</strong> and <strong>NI</strong> differ in what is expected after them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> must be followed by an <strong>inner predicate</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>NI</strong> must be followed by a <strong>definable word</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>O</strong> must be followed by a <strong>definable word</strong> then an <strong>inner predicate</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the first sentence of a paragraph doesn’t start with <strong>A/O/NI</strong>, then it is implicitly a <strong>a</strong>
sentence.</p>
<h2 id="a-family"><a class="header" href="#a-family">A family</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>a</strong> (assertion): <strong>a</strong> allows the speaker to make an assertion of a proposition (0-ary
predicate).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>an</strong> (context update): The context argument of the predicate wrapped with <strong>a</strong> is filled with a
globally managed context variable that can be updated using <strong>an</strong>. <strong>an</strong> wraps a 1-ary predicate
that takes as its parameter the new context, which can thus be constrained in terms of the current
implicit context argument. The vocabulary contains many predicates designed to easily be used with
<strong>an</strong> to provide many important concepts, such as tenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>al</strong> (injunction): <strong>al</strong> allows the speaker to make a request/order/command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>All <strong>A</strong> particles except <strong>an</strong> get their meaning from their associated compound <strong>e A sai</strong>
(<strong>e a sai</strong> for <strong>a</strong>, <strong>e al sai</strong> for <strong>al</strong>, …). This allows to easily add new sentence
starters similar to speech acts in other languages.</p>
<p><strong>e A ze</strong> can be used to state again the content of the last <strong>A</strong> sentence. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="o-family"><a class="header" href="#o-family">O family</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>o</strong> (question): <strong>o</strong> allows the speaker to ask a question by defining a predicate to be used by
the interlocutors. This predicate must then be used in reply.</p>
<p>A 0-ary predicate prompts the listener to assert it is true (a gi), that it is false (a bi/zi gi),
or that it is unknown (mui). (TODO: Add an easy way to state the <strong>answer</strong> to the question is
unknown / gi equivalent to mui).</p>
<p>Similarly, a higher arity predicate prompts the listener to provide the required arguments to make
the predicate true, to negate it if there are no such arguments, or to assert that it is unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>on</strong> (definition): <strong>on</strong> allows the speaker to assign a definition to a word, and is an
important tool to create the vocabulary of Eberban and avoid repetitions.</p>
<p>It can also be used by speakers to simplify complex sentences by defining part of it using <strong>on</strong>,
then using the defined predicate(s) in a <strong>a</strong> sentence.</p>
<p>Note that the definition doesn’t use the global context argument, and instead uses the context
argument provided by the sentence using this predicate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>oni</strong> (capturing definition): Same as <strong>on</strong> but captures the current global context. The
implicit context argument is ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>onu</strong> (performative / axiom definition): Shorthand of defining a predicate using <strong>on</strong> then
enabling it as an axiom with <strong>nu</strong>. Can be used as an equivalent to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performativity">performative</a> speech act
in natural language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ohi</strong> (imports): Imports definitions and enabled axioms from eberban quote in slot <strong>E</strong> under
the <strong>namespace</strong> represented by the “defined predicate” following <strong>ohi</strong>. Predicates in
namespaces can be used by prefixing them with the namespace predicate followed by <strong>PI</strong> (with
single member <strong>pi</strong>) If word <strong>ga</strong> is imported in <strong>namespace</strong> <strong>gi</strong> (using <code>ohi gi &lt;quote defining ga&gt;</code>), then it can be used with <code>gi pi ga</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>oie/oia/oio/oiu</strong> (set defaults): Set the default binding for a slot of the given predicate. See
<a href="logic/default.html">the chapter on defaults</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ni-family"><a class="header" href="#ni-family">NI family</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>nu</strong> (enable axiom): Considers the provided <em>definable word</em> as an axiom, a proposition that is
true by definition, and which is evaluated within the current global context.</p>
<p>Redefining this word will not change the enabled axiom, however enabling it again using <strong>nu</strong>
will disable the previous one and enable the new one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ni</strong> (disable axiom): Disable an axiom previously enabled with <strong>nu</strong>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>nohu</strong>: enable all axioms in given namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>nohi</strong>: disable all axioms in given namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>no</strong>: extract a predicate from its namespace to put it in the root namespace. Equivalent to
<code>on &lt;pred&gt; &lt;namespace&gt; pi &lt;pred&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>noi</strong>: extract all predicates from given namespace. <code>noi &lt;namespace&gt;</code> is equivalent to saying
<code>no &lt;namespace&gt; pi &lt;pred&gt;</code> for all <code>&lt;pred&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;namespace&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ra-and-ri-erasers"><a class="header" href="#ra-and-ri-erasers">RA and RI erasers</a></h2>
<p><strong>ra</strong> is a special word which erase anything said since the start of the current sentence, initial
<strong>A/O/NI</strong> included. It must be surrounded by spaces or pauses.</p>
<p>It is able to erase it even if the text is ungrammatical, and will erase anything back to the start
of the last sentence where the text was still grammatical (this means that an ungrammatical sentence
followed by grammatically-looking sentences actually just counts as a single ungrammatical
sentence).</p>
<p>However one must be careful with <a href="logic/../grammar/quotes.html">foreign quotes</a>. If the text was grammatical
until now, a <strong>ra</strong> appearing inside the foreign quote will be quoted and will not erase the
sentence. However if the sentence was ungrammatical, then <strong>ra</strong> will erase the sentence even if it
looks like it is inside a foreign quote. To avoid this issue, it is recommended to properlly close
the foreign quote (as if the text was grammatical), so that <strong>ra</strong> will properly erase the
sentence regardless of if the sentence was grammatical or not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exemple :</strong> <em>a sune <del>a not eberban text ra</del> a sunu</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To erase only a part of a sentence, <strong>RI</strong> can be used to erase the content of the current chain (it
must still be grammatical). If used inside a scope like <strong>VI/PE/..</strong> and more needs to be erased,
the chain must be made valid again (by adding a dummy <strong>ma</strong> for exemple), the scope needs to be
closed (with <strong>VEI/PEI/..</strong>), and then <strong>RI</strong> can be used again.</p>
<p><strong>VI/PE/..</strong> can thus also be used as a marker when you think you may make a mistake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exemple :</strong> <em>a mi pe <del>buri meon ri</del> etiansa meon</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="paragraph-marker-po"><a class="header" href="#paragraph-marker-po">Paragraph marker PO</a></h2>
<p><strong>PO</strong> can be placed before <strong>A/O/NI</strong> to mark a change of subject or
new paragraph. If <strong>PO</strong> is not followed by one of them then <strong>a</strong> is implied.
If multiple prefixes in a row are used it must be the first of them.</p>
<p><strong>PO</strong> contains 2 members <strong>po</strong> and <strong>poi</strong>, which affects definitions involving namespaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside a text imported with <strong>ohi</strong>, <strong>po</strong> marks the following definitions as <strong>public</strong>, meaning
they’ll be accessible in the namespace using <strong>PI</strong>. <strong>poi</strong> on the other end marks the following
definitions as <strong>private</strong>, making them inaccessible in the namespace. This allows to hide
implementation details.</li>
<li>Outside a text imported with <strong>ohi</strong>, predicates defined in a namespace will not be exported
by <strong>noi</strong> if defined in a <strong>poi</strong> paragraph, while they will be exported if defined in a <strong>po</strong>
paragraph. In both cases they are accessible with <strong>PI</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conversations-and-special-namespaces"><a class="header" href="#conversations-and-special-namespaces">Conversations and special namespaces</a></h2>
<p>In a conversion between multiple interlocutors, the following rules applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>the context is carried between the sentences of all interlocutors, in order of utturance</li>
<li>a context transformation is applied when changing speaker to update personal pronouns and related
concepts (TODO: create word for it and define how it works)</li>
<li>definitions made by an interlocutor applies to all. All interlocutors shares the same word
meanings in the <em>root namespace</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MI</strong> is used for special namespaces than can be used but not modified freely by the speakers, and
allows mitigating problems that can be caused by the above rules (like an interlocutor redefining
a word another wants to use for its former meaning).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mio</strong> (inclusive we) namespace contains all the words defined in the official dictionnary. It
can be used to access a word that has been overwritten by any interlocutor’s definition.</li>
<li><strong>mi</strong> (speaker) namespace contains all the words from <strong>mio</strong>, but is modified by any definitions
made by the speaker; and is not modified by definitions made by other interlocutors.</li>
<li><strong>mo</strong> (interlocutor) namespace contains all the words from <strong>mio</strong>, but is modified by any

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="logical-primitives-mi"><a class="header" href="#logical-primitives-mi">Logical primitives (MI)</a></h1>
<p>Particles of family <strong>MI</strong> (all particles starting with <em>m-</em>) act as predicate
words, and some of them are defined directly in logical notation with the goal
to express logical primitives that the grammar itself don’t cover.</p>
<p>\[ \begin{align}
\text{ma}(c,e)      &amp;= \text{is-atom}(e) \\
\text{mai}(c,e)     &amp;= \top \\
\text{mae}(c,E,A,o)   &amp;= \forall x_0 \dots \forall x_n. \ E(c,x_0,\dots,x_n) \Leftrightarrow A(c,o,x_0,\dots,x_n) \\
\text{mao}(c,e,A,O)   &amp;= \forall x_0 \dots \forall x_n. \ O(c,x_0,\dots,x_n) \Rightarrow A(c,x_0,\dots,x_n) \\
\text{mui}(c)       &amp;= \text{unknown} \\
\text{mue}(c,e)     &amp;= c = e \\
\text{mua}(c,e,A)   &amp;= A(e) \\
\end{align} \]</p>
<p><strong>ma</strong> (intransitive) wraps the primitive concept of its argument being an atom.</p>
<p><strong>mai</strong> (intransitive) puts no constraint on its argument, and is true for any possible $(e).
However to be used $(e) must exist (at some point an existential variable must
be created), and for some definitions expressing this existence and nothing
more is useful.</p>
<p><strong>mae</strong> (transitive) allows to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial
application</a>, stating that $(E) (which have $(n)
arguments) is equivalent to $(A) (which have $(n + 1) arguments) with its first slot “filled” by
$(o). It can be used to manipulate arguments as lists, perform operations on them and then evaluate
predicates with them.</p>
<p><strong>mao</strong> (transitive) allows the speaker to express the concept that $(A) is a subset of $(O),
in the sense that any list of arguments that satisfy $(A) also satisfy $(O). It
is useful as it doesn’t require the language itself to support a variable number
of arguments. Instead both $(A) and $(O) are just considered predicates of
possibly unknown arity and only the implication is relevant. $(A) and $(O)
can be of different arities, in which <strong>arity mismatch resolution</strong> can
be used to give them identical arity. This word can be useful for some
definitions, or to express that a predicate $(A) represents multiple
combinations of values that make $(O) true, that answers a question represented
by $(O). $(E) slot is skipped to make it easier to use in sentences.</p>
<p><strong>mui</strong> (intransitive) always returns the <strong>unknown</strong> truth value.</p>
<p><strong>mue</strong> (intransitive) and <strong>mua</strong> (transitive) allows the speaker to interact with the usually hidden
context argument. <strong>mue</strong> accepts a 1-ary predicate that is true when provided
the context as an <strong>explicit argument</strong>, while <strong>mua</strong> takes a proposition $(A)
and an atom $(e) such that $(A) is true when $(e) is provided as the hidden
context argument. These predicate words are what allows the context argument
to be really useful: the grammar automatically forwards the context parameter
for the speaker, which can then be used by predicates.</p>
<p>Other <strong>MI</strong> particles are not logical wrappers, they are simply root words
included in <strong>MI</strong> for convenience and will be explained in a later chapter.</p>

<h2 id="negations"><a class="header" href="#negations">Negations</a></h2>
<p><strong>zi</strong> allows the speaker to negate the predicate being prefixed. However,
it doesn’t negate any existential variables created when performing <strong>arity
mismatch resolution</strong>, other predicates in the chain, or explicit bindings.

</blockquote>
<p>When prefixing a compound, <strong>ze</strong> will refer to the lastest instance of that
exact compound. To make sentences shorter, <strong>zei</strong> can be used before a
predicate word to refer the latest compound containing this word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ze eberban</code> will refer to the latest <code>eberban</code> instance, while <code>zei ban</code> will
refer to the latest compound containing <code>ban</code>, for exemple <code>eberban</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which one is the <strong>latest instance</strong> is determined by word order in the text, and
using a predicate defined using this word doesn’t make it the <strong>latest</strong> again.
Thus in</p>
<p><em>on gia mian blan a <strong>mian</strong> etiansa a gia dona ze mian</em>,</p>
<p><em>ze mian</em> refers to the <strong>mian</strong> in bold in the <strong>a</strong> sentence, and not the
<strong>mian</strong> in <strong>gia</strong>’s definition.</p>
<p>However if the last instance of the word is indeed in a definition (or in some
predicate that can be used multiple times), then <strong>ze</strong> refers to the last time
it has been used. Thus in</p>
<p><em>on gia <strong>mian</strong> blan a gia dona ze mian</em>,</p>
<p><em>ze mian</em> refers to the <strong>mian</strong> inside <strong>gia</strong>’s definition, which is last
used in the <strong>a</strong> sentence. The text can thus be translated as
“A beautiful cat which likes itself”.</p>
<p><strong>zeu</strong> allows to refer to the <strong>context variable</strong> used to evaluate the
<strong>last instance</strong> of the predicate word, while <strong>zeiu</strong> does the same to refer
to the latest compound containing this word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: Formalize how anaphora behaves when the last instance was evaluated
multiple times with different values. This is related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_sentence">donkey anaphora</a> and

<p><span id="bo"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A related concept is <strong>forethought reference</strong> using <strong>KI/GI</strong> variables. A
<strong>KI/GI</strong> variable is first assigned by prefixing with <strong>bo</strong> before being
used in reference. Such <strong>KI</strong> variables can be used similarly to pronouns in
other languages. Such <strong>GI</strong> variables are more complex to use, but are
necessary to define some concepts of Eberban’s vocabulary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="instantiation"><a class="header" href="#instantiation">Instantiation</a></h1>
<p><strong>zu/zui</strong> allows the speaker to instantiate an argument of some predicate,
which is particularly useful when a predicate is shared using <strong>VI/FI</strong> or a
<strong>KI</strong> variable or argument and we want to use it with some arguments. <strong>GI</strong>
variables could be replaced with <strong>KI</strong> variables that are then used in chaining with
<strong>zu/zui</strong>. <strong>zu</strong> instantiates the predicate with <strong>transitive</strong> behavior while
<strong>zui</strong> is <strong>intransitive</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="other"><a class="header" href="#other">Other</a></h2>
<p><strong>zue</strong> allows the speaker to transform a predicate having an <strong>A</strong> 0-ary
predicate place to a predicate having an <strong>A</strong> 1-ary predicate place which is
satisfied by the <strong>E</strong> argument.</p>
<p><strong>mi katmi mi jvin</strong> (I want that [I dance]) can thus be replaced by <strong>mi zue
katmi jvin</strong> (I want to dance).</p>
<p>Note that they are not exactly equivalent, as in the first example the two
<strong>mi</strong> might not refer to the same individual(s)
(if there are multiple speakers), while in the second example it is necessarily
the same. Aside from this slight difference both examples are here the same
length and thus might seem a bit overkill, but it is more useful if the thing
being repeated is longer than one syllable.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="default-arguments"><a class="header" href="#default-arguments">Default arguments</a></h1>
<p>Some predicates are often used with the same arguments. While it can be possible to define new
predicates that wrap them and provide this argument, this would lead to multiple words for the same
concepts, and might not be practical for predicates made with some grammar rules such as numbers.
Also, those common arguments might be specific to some text or speech.</p>
<p>To address the above, Eberban allows the management of <strong>default arguments</strong>, which are properties
that some arguments must satisfy <strong>only when there are no explicit bounds on them</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s take as an example the predicate <strong>espuackuil</strong>, which means</p>
<p>\[\text{espuackuil}(c,e,a) = [\text{$e$ is the home stellar body of species $a$}]\]</p>
<p>We could want that <strong>A</strong> are humans by default so that we don’t have to always specify it is the
home planet of humans/Earth nor have to define another separate predicate.</p>
<p>To do that, we can use the <strong>oie/oia/oio/oiu</strong> series in <strong>O</strong> to define this default property. <code>oia espuackuil flan</code> defines that by default the <strong>A</strong> place of <strong>espuackuil</strong> satisfies the property
<strong>flan</strong> (being a human). The <strong>E</strong> place doesn’t have a default bind, which can be seen as having
the default bind of satisfying <strong>mai</strong> (exists).</p>

<p><code>oia espuackuil mai</code> can thus be used to “remove” the default human bind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This default property can be used with the <strong>zoie/zoia/zoio/zoiu</strong> series in <strong>ZI</strong>: <code>zoia espuackuil</code> is thus equivalent to <code>flan</code> in this case.</p>
<p>Any argument that is not re-exported as an argument of the wrapping predicate and not bound with
chaining or explicit binding automatically has the default bound.</p>
<p>If an argument is re-exported by the wrapping predicate, then the default bound is instead inherited
by the wrapped predicate (as if <strong>oie/etc</strong> was used on them too). This also applies with <strong>O</strong>
definitions, such as if we define the predicate <code>o ga espuackuil</code> then the <strong>A</strong> argument of <strong>ga</strong>
also defaults to <em>flan</em>, and <em>ga</em> can be used in place of <em>espuackuil</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that after defining <em>ga</em>, changing a default bind on <em>espuackuil</em> will not modify the
corresponding bind of <em>ga</em>. <code>oia ga ...</code> will thus be required instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is an example with all default bindings added: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>mi dona espuackuil</strong></p>
<p>\[ \begin{align}
\text{mi}(c,e)                &amp;= \text{[$e$ is a speaker]} \\

\end{align} \]</p>

<p>Manually binding the argument will prevent the default bind to be added:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dictionary-conventions"><a class="header" href="#dictionary-conventions">Dictionary conventions</a></h1>
<h2 id="notation"><a class="header" href="#notation">Notation</a></h2>
<p>The dictionary makes the distinction between meaning and definition.</p>
<h3 id="meaning"><a class="header" href="#meaning">Meaning</a></h3>
<p>The meaning of each word is written in English with arguments
being represented by vowels in brackets <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>The first time the vowel is used it is followed by one or more Eberban words.
These words denote the vowel’s type and constraints. Single letters like <code>a</code> can
be used to represent an argument’s generic type.</p>
<p>The same letter used in multiple places means the arguments share the same type.</p>
<p>Parentheses <code>()</code> represent predicate arguments (as opposed to atom or generic arguments),
where each argument constraint is listed in between, separated by commas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exemples of meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mi: [E:tce* man] is I/me/a speaker/author.</code></li>
<li><code>etiansa: [E:tce* den] eats [A:tce* den].</code></li>
<li><code>meon: [E:tce* den] is an apple.</code></li>
<li><code>[E:tcei a] is a (non-empty) set of some things that individualy satisfy [A:(tca a)].</code></li>
<li><code>mua: True if context [E:ma] makes [A:()] true.</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="definition"><a class="header" href="#definition">Definition</a></h3>
<p>The definition of each word is written in Eberban. Definitions either have an
argument list or re-export the places of the left-most predicate in the chain.</p>
<h2 id="set-arguments"><a class="header" href="#set-arguments">Set arguments</a></h2>
<p>Many predicates expect their arguments to be <strong>sets</strong>, which is expressed in
Eberban by the roots starting with <em>tc-</em>. <strong>tce</strong> in particular states that it
is a non-empty set. In definitions, a star <code>*</code> is added next to it when the
predicate uses this set in a <strong>distributive</strong> way, which means that the predicate
is also true if we provide a subset. Otherwise it is said to be <strong>collective</strong>,
and a set satisfying the predicate doesn’t necessarily imply that a subset of
it will also satisfy the predicate.</p>
<p>Having mainly set arguments like so means that, unless specified, the number of
members of the set is left vague. Thus, the sentence <em>mi etiansa meon</em> could
equally mean the following :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I</strong> eat <strong>one apple</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>We</strong> eat <strong>one apple</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>I</strong> eat <strong>multiple apples</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>We</strong> eat <strong>multiple apples</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also doesn’t specify <em>which</em> apples everyone is eating: <strong>bure</strong> is
satisfied if everyone eats at least one of the apples, and every apple is eaten
by at least one.</p>
<p>This allows the speaker to be vague by default. This can be made more precise by
adding more words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For simplicity, translations will be written in singular unless it is
important to make the distinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- ## Map arguments and context

Another kind of data structure used in eberban is a __map__ or __dictionary__,
which consist of a set of __keys__ each assiocated with a __value__. This allow
to "store" multiple information into a single atom. Since the context argument
is used to implement many features, it is thus using maps.

Definitions might refer to entries of such maps using the `@` symbol followed
by the name of the key. If `@` is used just after a vowel then it means the
vowel argument is map and the definition is refering to an entry of such map.
If there are no vowel before, it refers to an entry of the context argument.

Exemples will be given in later chapters when explaining concepts using contexts
or maps. -->

<p>Glosses should end with <code>:</code> is default chaining behavior chains to a predicate
place, meaning the following chain is “wrapped” in it. This can help learners

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="discourse-predicates-mi"><a class="header" href="#discourse-predicates-mi">Discourse predicates (MI)</a></h1>
<p>Discourse predicates are additional <strong>MI</strong> particles that don’t wrap logical primitives, but are
instead part of <strong>MI</strong> for historical reasons and are related to the discourse.</p>
<p><strong>mi</strong> (intransitive) refers to the speaker(s) in speech, or narrator(s) in writen media, with at
least one of the members being the main speaker/narrator.</p>
<p><strong>mo</strong> (intransitive) refers to the listerner(s)/interlocutor(s).</p>
<p><strong>mio</strong> (intransitive) refers to a set of individuals which includes at least the main speaker and
at least one of the listener(s)/interlocutor(s), and doesn’t include something that is neither a
speaker or listener. It can be seen as an <strong>inclusive we</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>mie</strong> (intransitive) on the other hand refers to a set of individuals which includes at least the
main speakers and which can include anything that <strong>is not</strong> the listener. It can be seen as an
<strong>exclusive we</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>moe</strong> (intransitive) refers to a set of individuals which includes neither speakers bor listeners.
It can be seen as <strong>third person pronoun</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>me</strong> (intransitive) is something that the speaker(s) particulary have in mind. Corresponds loosely
to <em>the</em> or <em>this</em> in English.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="borrowings-u-"><a class="header" href="#borrowings-u-">Borrowings (u-)</a></h1>
<p>Borrowings allow importing words from other languages which would be
difficult or even impossible to translate using root words, such as proper
names, names of species, and some cultural concepts Eberban avoids including
in its roots to be more culturally neutral.</p>
<p>Borrowings start with the letter <strong>u</strong>, followed by the borrowed word written
in the phonology and morphology allowed by Eberban while trying to stay
close to the original pronounciation.</p>
<p>If the borrowed word starts with <strong>u</strong> then the prefix used is <strong>u’</strong> to avoid
2 consecutive <em>u</em>.</p>
<p>A chain of multiple borrowings will count as only one predicate composed of
multiple parts. To prevent two borrowings from fusing into one predicate, you
can separate them with the particle <strong>be</strong> (<strong>be</strong> can optionally appear after
every borrowing group but is only necessary when separating multiple groups).</p>
<p>A borrowing’s meaning is not defined in Eberban, and its truth value is always 
undefined. It can be used to import foreign words that interlocutors will 
collectively understand, but using non-borrowings is always preferred if
possible. Borrowings can have any number of arguments, and since it is not
defined in Eberban, each of them is considered to be generic. No type inference
can be informed, therefore, <code>vie/via/...</code> must be used for predicate equivalence
bindings.</p>
<p>Like roots and compounds, borrowings are transitive if they end with a vowel,
while they are intransitive if they end with a consonant (not only sonorants).</p>
<p>Borrowings can be used to import proper nouns by prefixing them with particle
<strong>za</strong>, which gives it the meaning <code>[tce* man] is named [borrowed word]</code> (a
more complete explanation of <strong>za</strong> will be given at a later chapter).</p>
<h2 id="example-2"><a class="header" href="#example-2">Example</a></h2>
<div data-gloss>

<p>mi {za umia uentropi} {(be)}</p>

<p>I am named “mia entropi”.</p>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compounds-e-"><a class="header" href="#compounds-e-">Compounds (e-)</a></h1>
<p>Providing a root for every concept would be extremely impractical and isn’t great for memorization.
Complex concepts are often built upon multiple primitive concepts, and compounds are used for this
purpose.</p>
<p>Compounds allow the transformation of any string of valid Eberban words (particles, roots and
borrowings) into a single unit. While a compound <strong>ignores the grammatical rules of the individual
words</strong>, its meaning should (to a certain extent) be related.</p>
<p>A compound start with either <strong>e, en, er</strong>, respectively starting a compound composed of two, three,
or more words. er-compounds stop when a single <strong>e</strong> is encountered (with a space before it). Spaces
can be inserted between any parts of the compound.</p>
<p>If the first word starts with a vowel (a borrowing or <strong>A/O</strong> particle) then the pause before this
vowel is optional. <strong>NI</strong> particles needs to be prefixed by a pause or space to not be confused with
the <strong>en</strong> start.</p>
<p>Compounds have <strong>unique and fixed meanings which are defined in the dictionary</strong>, and while the
definition of each one can be arbitrary, they usually provide arguments taken from their individual
components. Usually, the most important word is the rightmost one, and additional words are added to
the left to help narrow down the meaning, yielding greater precision.</p>
<p>It is common to lexicalize a borrowing by making a compound with it. Cultural concepts are borrowed
with endonyms, sounding similar to the original word.</p>
<p>A compound have the same <strong>transitivity</strong> as its last/rightmost component (transitive/intransitive +
if that place is bounded with sharing/equivalence). If the compound transitivity should differ from
that component, an extra word is added in the compound among the followings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>se</strong>: intransitive sharing</li>
<li><strong>sa</strong>: transitive sharing</li>
<li><strong>sai</strong>: transitive equivalence</li>
</ul>
<p>Other particles that cannot be used directly as predicates are considered intransitive sharing.</p>

series of vowels which can be separated by h.</p>
<p>Since spelling is usually used in noisy environments to clarify how words are
written, units representing Eberban characters include some redundancy to help
recognition.</p>

quotes as <strong>cai</strong> will match its opening <strong>ca</strong>. The quote acts as a predicate
with meaning <code>[E:tca ecaskan] is text [text].</code> (<strong>ecaskan</strong> being the predicate
word for a grammatically correct Eberban quote, while <strong>skan</strong> is the word for a
quote or string of arbitrary data).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>co</strong> (<strong>CO</strong>) allows quoting anything such as foreign text, grammatically incorrect Eberban text,
or even arbitrary data. <strong>co</strong> has two quotation modes :</p>
<ul>

until <strong>]</strong> is reached. Thus this cannot quote text that contains <strong>]</strong>. </li>
<li>otherwise it is followed by a single arbitrary root or particle, which has the role of a delimiter
(it is not necessary for it to be an existing particle or root, only a valid form), followed by
<strong>[</strong>. Any following characters (including spaces) are considered part of the quoted text, while in
speech following pause is also considered part of the quote. The quote ends when this word appears
again prefixed by <strong>]</strong>. The delimiter word prefixed by a <strong>]</strong> must <strong>NOT</strong> appear in the text,
either written with same letters or pronounced the same way (reminder that <strong>]</strong> is uttered as a
palatal click), as it will be considered to be the end of the quote, and the remaining part will
leak out of the quote.</li>

<p>This whole block acts as a predicate with the definition <code>[E:tca skan] is foreign text/arbitrary data with content: [content].</code></p>
<p>As the content may be unreadable for the speaker, they can use the single word
<strong>coi</strong> (<strong>COI</strong>) instead of the full quote. Foreign quotes are the canonical
way to embed things such as images or URLs into Eberban text. It is recommended
however to provide a description in Eberban to help comprehension for all

<p>We’ve seen before particles <strong>pe</strong> and <strong>pei</strong> that are like spoken brackets. <strong>pe</strong> is part of
family <strong>PE</strong> which provide a more general feature called an <em>enumeration</em>. It allows to list
<em>items</em> which are used differently depending on which <strong>PE</strong> is used. Items separation is done using
<strong>bu</strong> (only member of <strong>BU</strong>) in 2 possible mays:</p>
<ul>
<li>separator: <strong>PE</strong> is followed by multiple chains, each separated by <strong>bu</strong>.</li>
<li>prefix: <strong>PE</strong> is immediatly followed by <strong>bu</strong>. Then each item is a single predicate, and items
are not separated by <strong>bu</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PE</strong> family contains the following members:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pe</strong>: Simply exposes the slots of the items. If there are multiple items, it perform an AND
operator between them.
<blockquote>
<p>Exemple: <code>mi [pe [etiansa] bu [dona] pei] meon</code> = I [eat and like] an apple.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>pea</strong>: Makes a set from one member of each listed sets.
<blockquote>
<p>Exemple: <code>mio [pea bu [za ualis] [za ubob] (pei)]</code> = We are Alice and Bob.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>peo</strong>: Makes a set such that a generic/atom that satisfy each item is a member of the set.
<blockquote>
<p>Exemple: <code>[peo [tcu mian] bu [meon] (pei)]</code> = A set of {the set of all cats, a set of apples}.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>peho</strong>: Makes a set of predicates.
<blockquote>
<p>Exemple: <code>me vone [peho bu [mian] [meon] (pei)]</code> = This is [a cat OR an apple].</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>peu</strong>: Makes a list such that a generic/atom that satisfy each item is a member of the list (in
order).
<blockquote>
<p>Exemple: <code>[peu bu [mian] [meon] pei] blua [peu [meon] bu [mian] (pei)]</code> = List [a cat, an apple]
is list [an apple, a cat] in reverse order.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>pehu</strong>: Makes a list of predicates.
<blockquote>
<p>No exemple as usages of predicates lists as they are mostly used by words with complex meanings.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An empty enum can be made with <code>PE bu PEI</code>. However Eberban doesn’t consider the empty set exists,
while the empty list does. When used with <strong>pe</strong>, it makes an always true predicate.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="adverbs-and-prepositions-voifoi"><a class="header" href="#adverbs-and-prepositions-voifoi">Adverbs and prepositions (voi/foi)</a></h1>
<p><strong>voi/foi</strong> can be used to attach a single predicate X as an adverb of another predicate Y. Y
will be evaluated by X (by binding Y to the A slot of X), however the predicate resulting from
the combination of adverb X and Y is a new predicate exposing all the slots of X. It means
explicit bounds or chaining of Y will interact with its slots, but will not be evaluated inside of
X.</p>
<p>This is very useful where X is a context-modifying predicate, as it avoids further bindings to be
affected by that context modification.</p>
<p>For exemple, with <code>sru</code> meaning <code>[A:()] will occur</code>, usage with and without <strong>voi</strong> differs in
meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mi etiansa (Y) voi sru (X) fa meon</code> = I will eat an apple (which exists now)</li>
<li><code>mi sru etiansa meon</code> = I will eat an apple (which will exist)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any predicates present after the single predicate X form a chain C which will be sharing-bound to the E
slot of X. This allows to have preposition-like clauses.</p>
<p>For exemple, with <code>epaneski</code> meaning <code>Inside of [E:tce pan], [A:()] occurs</code> and <code>sru</code> meaning <code>[A:()] occured</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mi etiansa (Y) voi epaneski (X) spua fa meon sae duna (Y2) voi sru (X2) fa mo</code>: I eat in the house an apple that you gave
me (you’re not necessarily in the house)</li>
<li><code>spua epaneski mi etiansa meon sae duna voi sru fa mo</code>: In the house: I eat an apple that you gave me
(you were in the house and that’s where you gave the apple to me)</li>

<p>Numbers are important to communicate and serve many purposes. Eberban numbers
are expressed as a chain of <strong>TI</strong> particles (any particles starting with <em>t-</em>),
which can optionally contain separators and a terminator starting with <em>j-</em> to
make more advanced numbers.</p>
<h2 id="digits"><a class="header" href="#digits">Digits</a></h2>
<p>Numbers are mainly composed of digits (<strong>TI</strong> family), which are chained one
after the other, starting from the highest significant one to the lowest, and is
by default expressed in base ten.</p>

<ol>
<li>Optionaly the <em>base</em> of the number can be expressed by a single <strong>TI</strong>
followed by <strong>ju</strong>. This <strong>TI</strong> is the last digit of the base used, thus
<strong>tei ju</strong> is base ten, <strong>teo ju</strong> is base twelve, and <strong>tao ju</strong> is
hexadecimal. If absent it defaults to base ten (<strong>tei ju</strong>), unless the default
base is overwritten in the context (TODO: Add word to set such default base).</li>
<li>The <em>integer part</em> of the number, as a string of zero or more digits <strong>TI</strong>.
If there are zero digits then a fractional part is mandatory, unless <strong>je</strong> is used.</li>
<li>This integer part can then optionally be followed by <strong>jo</strong> and a <em>fractional
part</em> which is also a string of zero or more digits <strong>TI</strong>. <strong>joi</strong> can be used instead to also
make the number negative.</li>
<li>If there is a fractional part, it can be followed by <strong>ja</strong> and a <em>repeated part</em> which is also a
string of at least one digit <strong>TI</strong>. The number has these digits repeated indefinitely.</li>
<li>Regardless of the presence of a fractional part or integer part, the number can then contain
<strong>je</strong> followed by a <em>magnitude</em>, which is a string of at least one digit <strong>TI</strong>. The value
expressed is the previous part multiplied by \(\text{base}^{\text{magnitude}}\). <strong>jei</strong> can be
used instead to express a negative magnitude. If only the magnitude is present then the integer
part is considered to be equal <strong>1</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="various-usage-of-numbers"><a class="header" href="#various-usage-of-numbers">Various usage of numbers</a></h2>
<p>Numbers have various usages which require different definitions and arguments.
The desired definition can be selected by ending the number with a particle of
family <strong>JI</strong> (<strong>jie</strong> is inferred if omitted). <strong>jie</strong> is mandatory between
consecutive numbers to tell them apart. Particles other than <strong>jie</strong> must follow
positive integer (no fractional part).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ji</strong>: <code>[E:tce* a] is (a group of) [number] things satisfying [A:(tca a)].</code><br />
Speaks about a set of expressed cardinality.</li>
<li><strong>jia</strong>: <code>[E:tce* a] is (a group of) [number] things satisfying [A:(a)].</code><br />
Same but uses the raw property variant of set definitions.</li>
<li><strong>jio</strong>: <code>[E:tcu a] is (a group of) the only [number] things satisfying [A:(tca a)].</code><br />
These are the only things that satisfy the property. There is nothing that
satisfies A which is not in the set.</li>
<li><strong>jioa</strong>: <code>[E:tcu a] is (a group of) the only [number] things satisfying [A:(a)].</code><br />
Same but uses the raw property variant of set definitions.</li>
<li><strong>jiu</strong>: <code>[E:tca a] is the [number]th member of sequence [A:blu a].</code><br />
Speaks about an element in an ordered list. Index follows zero-based numbering, such that
the first element is the 0th.</li>
<li><strong>jie</strong>: <code>[E:tce gan] is the number [number] times [A:tce gan] (default: 1 unitless).</code><br />
<code>gan</code> is the word for a number, and both arguments are sets of numbers. These
sets allow handling many numbers (ranges, approximations, or even arbitrarily
constructed ones), and math operations are also defined using sets to
distributively operate on each value of the set. The <strong>A</strong> argument allows 
multiplying this number with another number such as unit numbers (“1 meter”,
“1 kilogram”, etc). The <strong>A</strong> argument defaults to <strong>1 unitless</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <em>raw property of set definitions</em> refers to the fact that sets
have two types of predicates: one where a member must satisfy argument <code>(a)</code> and
the other <code>(tca a)</code>. Many predicates expect their arguments to be sets, so the
latter is usually used. The former allows accessing raw members, an example use
case is dealing with nested sets.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="annotations-d-"><a class="header" href="#annotations-d-">Annotations (d-)</a></h1>
<p>Annotations are additional grammar that don’t modify the logical meaning of the
text, and simply add notes or metadata. These annotations are also called “free”
prefixes and suffixes as they can be added freely before and after many elements
of the grammar.</p>
<h2 id="free-scope"><a class="header" href="#free-scope">Free scope</a></h2>
<p>By default annotations are somewhat related only to the word they are attached
to. However the scope can be changed by prefixing the annotation with <strong>DU</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>du</strong>: Annotation refers to the annotated predicate, its explicit bindings and its following chaining.</li>
<li><strong>duo</strong>: Annotation refers to the entire sentence.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="free-prefixes-di"><a class="header" href="#free-prefixes-di">Free prefixes DI</a></h2>
<p><strong>DI</strong> contains all particles starting with <em>di-</em> and are prefixes to other
elements of the grammar. They currently contains particles related to “focus”:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>di</strong>: Attention focus: the listener should be extra attentive to the
following word. Maybe it would be especially prone to confusion? </li>
<li><strong>die</strong>: Contrastive focus: It’s that thing and not something else that was
expected. </li>
<li><strong>dia</strong>: Newsworthiness focus: Marks the part of the sentence containing the
most important new information.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="free-interjection-de-suffix"><a class="header" href="#free-interjection-de-suffix">Free interjection DE (suffix)</a></h2>
<p><strong>DE</strong> contains all particles starting with <em>de-</em> and is a suffix to other
elements of the grammar. It is followed by a single predicate which can be
prefixed by <strong>SI/ZI</strong>. However it doesn’t support chains of predicates, unless
they are wrapped in <strong>pe … pei</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>de</strong> uses this predicate as an interjection. Using a borrowing can be used
to make onomatopoeia, like <code>de uahaha</code> for laughter. Using a predicate word
could be compared to emojis or lojban’s attitudinals, like <code>de gali</code> (love/❤️).</p>
<p><strong>dei</strong> uses this predicate as a metadata tag or <em>#hashtag</em>.</p>
<h2 id="free-parenthetical-dadai-suffix"><a class="header" href="#free-parenthetical-dadai-suffix">Free parenthetical DA…DAI (suffix)</a></h2>
<p>The families <strong>DA</strong> and <strong>DAI</strong> have single members <strong>da</strong> and <strong>dai</strong>

<strong>DAI</strong>. This note can be any valid eberban text.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="guidelines"><a class="header" href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a></h1>
<p>To simplify designing and learning groups of words, they are usually designed by following a
pattern like a common prefix. To stay consistent across the whole dictionary those patterns should
follow the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vowels IEAOU encode order and scale, from small/negative to big/positive. As final -i encodes
the type of the transitive place, it should be skipped in final vowel patterns.</li>
<li>Vowels can encode direction by following the following cross diagram. As A is the loudest vowed
and the 3rd vowel out of 5, it is used to represent forward. I is used for the center and other
vowels are placed in counter-clockwise order.
<pre><code>  A
  |
  |
O-I-E
  |
  U
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Vowel patterns should be prefered over sonorant patterns. If sonorant patterns are used they
should follow the same guidelines with NRL order.</li>

<p>Time is represented using a graph of instants. It supports multiple possible futures and pasts,
parallel and fictional universes. The context variable caries time-related information to time-aware
predicates that handles time for you behind the scene.</p>
<p>Physical entities (<em>pan</em>) are associated with the space-time volume (<em>skan</em>) they occupy, as the
spatial volume they occupy at each instant they exist (possibly along multiple timelines).</p>
<img src="vocabulary/timelines.svg" style="width: 100%;"/>
<h2 id="common-timespan"><a class="header" href="#common-timespan">Common timespan</a></h2>
<p>Each use of <em>pan</em> interacts with a time interval (formed by a start and end instant, and a specific
path connecting them) stored in the context called the <strong>common timespan</strong>. Each <em>pan</em> states that
the physical entity exists during the <strong>common timespan</strong> (it may exist outside of it), and words
describing an action like <em>etiansa</em> (eat) states that the <strong>common timespan</strong> is contained during
the timespan of the action. The <strong>common timespan</strong> is thus the intersection of all the time spans
of all involved physical entities and actions.</p>
<p>This <strong>common timespan</strong> is placed in the context by <em>ski</em> and time relations words, which constrain
it to be maximal (given some timespan <em>x</em>, there doesn’t exist another timespan <em>y</em> that contains
<em>x</em> which makes the proposition true; this timespan <em>y</em> is not contained by one or many timespans of
involved physical entities or actions).</p>
<p>This design allows to easily express events involving many entities and actions. The sentence “In
this room there is an cat, and you eating an apple” expresses the presence of the cat while you’re
eating an apple. The existence of the cat, you, the apple and the action of eating all contains the
<strong>common timespan</strong> (and they can unfold outside of it).</p>
<h2 id="time-anchor"><a class="header" href="#time-anchor">Time anchor</a></h2>
<p>The time anchor is a timespan that is automatically stated to be contained by the <strong>sentence common
timespan</strong>, and which is usually the <strong>present</strong>.</p>
<p>The current time anchor can be refered to using <em>skun</em>, and <em>en an skun sai</em> can be used in a <em>an</em>
sentence to change the time anchor for future sentences.</p>
<p>The real world present can be refered to using <em>sufkun</em>, which is updated between each sentence to
“move forward in time”.</p>
<h2 id="time-relations"><a class="header" href="#time-relations">Time relations</a></h2>
<p>Time relations relates an <strong>inner proposition</strong> (it’s A slot) with a reference event (E slot), which
by default is the <strong>outer proposition</strong> current event.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>sre</em>: A <strong>is before</strong> E: end of A is before the start of E</li>
<li><em>sra</em>: A <strong>starts</strong> E: start of A is start of E</li>
<li><em>sro</em>: A <strong>finishes</strong> E: end of A is end of E</li>
<li><em>sru</em>: A <strong>is after</strong> E: start of A is after the end of E</li>

<li><em>srai</em>: A <strong>intersects with</strong> E</li>
<li><em>sri</em>: A <strong>is unconstrained by</strong> E (but still reachable from E).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>sre</em> (before) and <em>sru</em> (after) have an O slot for the duration separating the 2 timespans. As
giving a precise duration may be difficult or too precise, compounds with time units are made to
give a vague time scale of such duration :</p>
<ul>
<li><em>e ti sre/sru</em>: very short time for common speech, less than 1 second (excluded)</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-are-events-modeled"><a class="header" href="#how-are-events-modeled">How are events modeled?</a></h2>
<p>An event (<em>ski</em>) is modeled as an object containing the following information:</p>

<li>The proposition describing the event</li>
<li>The set of all physical entities involved in the proposition, each with their associated
space-time volume</li>
<li>Possibly other informations, this will be figured out with usage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="event-words"><a class="header" href="#event-words">Event words</a></h2>
<p><em>ski</em> allows to related an event (E slot) with its defining propositon (A slot). It evaluates this
proposition with its own <strong>inner common timespan</strong>, and doesn’t relate it with another event. “I
like the event of [you dance]” doesn’t means that the “liking” and the “dancing” occurs at the same
time. Inside a <em>ski</em> or in a sentence, <em>skul</em> can be used to refer to the current event.</p>
<!-- *skun* allows to state that a given event (E slot) is occuring in the **outer common timespan** with

<p>Duration words allows to measure elpased time that may not be aligned to the calendar, such as the

which means the first day of the week/month/year is day 0, and the first month of the year is month
0. You should thus be careful when translating a date from and to Eberban.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>birei</strong>: Now is year <strong>E</strong> (default: 0) of <strong>A</strong> (default: Gregorian Calendar). Year 1 is 1 AD, but year 0

by the observer (unless they are color blind).</p>
<p>The words for the colors themselves follow the pattern zmXr and are based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSV coordinate

<p>As presented in the morphology chapter, Eberban can be written using the Latin
alphabet. However, there is also a custom writing system that takes advantage of
Eberban’s morphology which is usable in a <strong>linear form</strong> similar to how text is
written in the Latin alphabet, and in a <strong>planar form</strong> which replaces argument
binding particles like <strong>VI, FI or SI</strong> with graphical 2D notation.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="linear-writing-system"><a class="header" href="#linear-writing-system">Linear writing system</a></h1>
<img src="writing/symbols.svg" style="width: 100%; background: white; border: 2px solid black" />
<p>The linear writing system is structured around syllables with a vowel written in the center and the
consonants or sonorants being written above or below, forming four corners (up left, up right, down
left, down right). </p>
<ul>
<li>If a syllable starts with a sonorant (N-initial particles, or multi-syllables words like
ma-<strong>na</strong>.), it can be written either in the top or bottom left. </li>
<li>If a syllable starts with one or two consonants, they must be placed up or down depending if the
first consonant is unvoiced (up) or voiced (down). If there are two consonants they occupy thus
both left and right place. We know the right one doesn’t correspond to the syllable end because
there is another consonant on its left.</li>
<li>If a syllable ends with a sonorant and is the last syllable of the word, it must be placed on the
right and opposite side of the initial consonant or sonorant. If there is no initial it can be
written either up or down.</li>
<li>If a syllable ends with a consonant because it is part of a medial pair or triplet, then the first
consonant must be placed on the opposite side of the initial consonant of the current syllable,
and the following consonants will be written at the start of the next syllable (following syllable
start rules). This means that for exemple in <code>vog-bi</code>, since initial <code>v</code> is written at the bottom
left, the <code>g</code> must be written at the top right, even though it is voiced and thus is usually
written at the bottom. We know it’s a <code>g</code> and not a <code>k</code> thanks to the following <code>b</code> which is
voiced and thus written at the bottom left. If the syllable doesn’t have an initial consonant it
is adviced to write the ending consonant on its usual side, however it is not mandatory.</li>
<li>This writting system ignores spaces. Use symbol for pause (<code>'</code>) when necessary. In borrowings and
freeform variables ending with a consonant, it must be written at the start of the pause symbol
(avoiding the ambiguity of consonants at the end of syllable which is usually resolved thanks to
the following consonant, while there is none here).</li>

<h2 id="computer-font"><a class="header" href="#computer-font">Computer font</a></h2>
<p>A computer font is <a href="https://eberban.github.io/eberban/font/eberban-Regular.otf">available to
download</a>.</p>
<p>To write with this font some modifications needs to be made to texts to be rendered properly.
However it uses the fact that the Eberban grammar doesn’t care of case or repeated letters. This
thus mean that text written with this font is perfectly valid Eberban but may look a bit odd (with
repeated letters, uppercase and hyphens) when displayed with another font.</p>
<p>The font works by only having vowels, <code>'</code> and space moving the cursor forward. Consonants, sonorants
and <code>H</code> are written without moving the cursor and <em>stacks</em> above or below the following vowel. They
are however not automatically moved to the right or the opposite side, and the following
modifications must be made :</p>
<ul>
<li>initial pair: the second consonant (or sonorant) must be doubled to be shifted to the right. <code>tcu</code>
must thus be written <code>tccu</code>.</li>
<li>medial pairs and triplets: medial pairs consonants (or sonorants) are split between the end of the
a syllable and the start of the next.
<ul>
<li>If the first letter can be written on the correct side (up/down), an hyphen <code>-</code> must be written
between them to shirt the first letter in the correct place. <code>padgon</code> is thus written <code>pad-gon</code>.</li>
<li>If the first letter must be written on the opposite side, it just needs to be written in
uppercase. <code>vogbi</code> is thus written <code>voGbi</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sonorants: sonorants by default are considered to be at the start of a syllable. In words ending
with a sonorant however they should be placed at the end of the syllable. Writing a space after
them shift them to the correct place. Sonorants at the start of a medial pair or a triplet in a
borrowing also support being followed by an hyphen <code>-</code>, as a space would break the word apart.</li>
<li>sonorants, M and H: by default they are written above the vowels, but writing them uppercase moves
them below.</li>
</ul>
