# Introduction

__Eberban__ is a [logical] [constructed language] aimed to satisfy the
following goals :

- __being simple :__ the Eberban grammar allows the manipulation of predicates
  with particles in a way that is close to the [higher-order logic] it
  translates into, while abstracting away the verbosity of explicitly
  providing variables as arguments of predicates.
- __being regular :__ valid sentences are syntactically unambiguous. Most
  grammar rules rely on particles which are organised into families, each
  starting with a unique prefix. Many additional patterns are shared between
  particles and predicate words to help with learning groups of related words.
- __being expressive :__ the grammar and core vocabulary focus on providing a
  simple framework, on top of which can be built abstractions, complex concepts
  and tools. Since those are built into Eberban itself, users can create their
  own tools and abstractions to express entirely new concepts.

__Eberban__ takes inspiration from [Lojban] and other logical languages, but
tries novel approaches to satisfy the above goals.

Most resources are hosted on [GitHub pages], such as :

- parsers, which transform text into a tree structure, that can also be
  visualized as nested boxes.
- a dictionary to search words and their definitions.
- learning resources to discover the language grammar and concepts.
