# Predicate transformations (ZI)

Particles of the __ZI__ family (all particles starting with _z-_) are used to 
transform the immediately following predicate, before chaining or explicit 
bindings are performed.

> To use a __ZI__ on more than one predicate word it should be wrapped in
> brackets __pe ... pei__, which itself will be prefixed with __ZI__.

## Negations

__zi__ allows the speaker to negate the predicate being prefixed. However,
it doesn't negate any existential variables created when performing __arity
mismatch resolution__, other predicates in the chain, or explicit bindings.
__zi__ is called the __short scope negation__.

> __mi zi buri meon__
>
> \\[ \begin{align}
> \text{mi}(c,e)       &= \text{[$e$ is a speaker]} \\\\
> \text{buri}(c,e,a)   &= \text{[$e$ eats $a$]} \\\\
> \text{meon}(c,e)     &= \text{[$e$ is an apple]} \\\\
> \\ \\\\
> \text{meon}_1(c,e)   &= \text{meon}(c,e) \\\\
> \\ \\\\
> \text{buri}_1(c,e,a) &= \color{magenta}{(\neg \text{buri}(c,e,a))} \wedge \text{meon}_1(c,e) \\\\
> \text{buri}^w_1(c,e) &= \exists a. \text{buri}_1(c,e,a) \\\\
> \\ \\\\
> \text{mi}_1(c,e)     &= \text{mi}(c,e) \wedge \text{buri}^w_1(c,e) \\\\
> \text{mi}^w_1(c)     &= \exists e. \text{mi}_1(c,e)
> \end{align} \\]
> 
> Assertion given $(c):\
> I and an apple exists, but I don't eat it.\
> Would be false if no apple existed.

There also exists a __long scope negation__ with particle __bi__, which also
negates existential variables introduced by the arity mismatch resultion and
other predicates in the chain or explicit bindings.

> __mi bi buri meon__

> \\[ \begin{align}
> \text{buri}_1(c,e,a) &= \text{buri}(c,e,a) \wedge \text{meon}(c,e) \\\\
> \text{buri}^w_1(c,e) &= \color{magenta}{\neg (\exists a. \text{buri}_1(c,e,a))} \\\\
> \\ \\\\
> \text{mi}_1(c,e)     &= \text{mi}(c,e) \wedge \text{buri}^w_1(c,e) \\\\
> \text{mi}^w_1(c)     &= \exists e. \text{mi}_1(c,e)
> \end{align} \\]
> 
> Assertion given $(c):\
> I exist and it is false that I eat an apple.\
> It doesn't imply the existence of an apple.

## Names

Prefixing a 1-ary predicate with __za__ transforms it into a name:
\\([\text{$e$ is named with property $P$} by $a$]\\). __SI__ can be added between
__za__ and the predicate to select which argument is used for the property.
__za__ is intransitive as it is most of the time not needed to define who named
$e$ like that.

To speak about the name itself, __zai__ must be used:
\\([\text{$e$ is the name corresponding to property $P$}]\\).

> Many things can have the same name, but the name itself is unique.

## Reference

__ze__ allows the speaker to refer to the latest __non-wrapped__ instance of the
prefixed predicate instead of creating a new instance. Arguments provided to
this reference predicate (ignoring the implicit context argument) are stated to
be equal to the ones the instance had.

> __mian buri
> pa mi dona ze mian__
>
> \\[ \begin{align}
> \text{mian}(c,e)                         &= \text{[$e$ is a cat]} \\\\
> \text{dona}(c,e,a)                       &= \text{[$e$ likes $a$]} \\\\
> \\ \\\\
> \text{buri}_1(c,e,a)                     &= \text{buri}(c,e,a) \\\\
> \text{buri}^w_1(c,e)                     &= \exists a. \text{buri}_1(c,e,a) \\\\
> \\ \\\\

> \\ \\\\
> \color{magenta}{\text{ze-mian}_1(c,e)}   &= \color{magenta}{e = e_1} \\\\
> \text{dona}_1(c,e_2,a_2)                 &= \text{dona}(c,e_2,a_2) \wedge \color{magenta}{\text{ze-mian}_1(c,a)} \\\\
> \text{dona}^w_1(c,e)                     &= \exists a. \text{dona}_1(c,e,a) \\\\
> \\ \\\\
> \text{mi}_1(c,e)                         &= \text{mi}(c,e) \wedge \text{dona}^w_1(c,e) \\\\
> \text{mi}^w_1(c)                         &= \exists e. \text{mi}_1(c,e) \\\\
> \end{align} \\]

> Assertion given $(c): I like __this cat__.

When prefixing a compound, __ze__ will refer to the lastest instance of that
exact compound. To make sentences shorter, __zei__ can be used before a
predicate word to refer the latest compound containing this word.

> `ze eberban` will refer to the latest `eberban` instance, while `zei ban` will
> refer to the latest compound containing `ban`, for exemple `eberban`.

Which one is the __latest instance__ is determined by word order in the text, and
using a predicate defined using this word doesn't make it the __latest__ again.
Thus in

_po gia mian blan pa __mian__ buri pa gia dona ze mian_,

_ze mian_ refers to the __mian__ in bold in the __pa__ sentence, and not the
__mian__ in __gia__'s definition.

However if the last instance of the word is indeed in a definition (or in some
predicate that can be used multiple times), then __ze__ refers to the last time
it has been used. Thus in

_po gia __mian__ blan pa gia dona ze mian_,

_ze mian_ refers to the __mian__ inside __gia__'s definition, which is last
used in the __pa__ sentence. The text can thus be translated as
"A beautiful cat which likes itself".

With some predicates such as sets (__tcu__ and other __tc-__ initials) the
order in which the predicate is used is not defined. In this case __ze__ refers
arbitrarily to one of them (which hypotetically would be the "last one"). Thus
in

_pa meon sae buri tce __mian__ pa mi dona ze mian_

can be translated as "An apple is eaten by some cats. I like one of those
cats." It is however preferred to not refer to such an unordered instance, and
instead refer to a clearly ordered word such as __tce__, for which we can speak
about one of its members with __tci__ (is a member of) :

_pa meon sae buri __tce__ mian pa mi dona tci ze tce_

# Instantiation

__zu/zui__ allows the speaker to instantiate an argument of some predicate,
which is particularly useful when a predicate is shared using __VI/FI__ or a
__KI__ variable or argument and we want to use it with some arguments. __GI__
variables could be replaced with __KI__ variables that are then used in chaining with
__zu/zui__. __zu__ instantiates the predicate with __transitive__ behavior while
__zui__ is __intransitive__.

## Other

__zue__ allows the speaker to transform a predicate having an __A__ 0-ary 
predicate place to a predicate having an __A__ 1-ary predicate place which is 
satisfied by the __E__ argument.

__mi jine mi jvin__ (I want that [I dance]) can thus be replaced by __mi zue
jine jvin__ (I want to dance).

Note that they are not exactly equivalent, as in the first example the two
__mi__ might not refer to the same individual(s)
(if there are multiple speakers), while in the second example it is necessarily
the same. Aside from this slight difference both examples are here the same
length and thus might seem a bit overkill, but it is more useful if the thing
being repeated is longer than one syllable.
