# Identifiers

Identifiers are the names themselves. Each of them corresponds to an atom
prefixed by the particle __zai__. Since each name also corresponds to a
property, we can define this concept using a pair. In this pair, the left
component is an atom representing the concept of identifiers and the right
component is the property.

<spoiler>

__[ezaige]:__ `[E:ma]` is an identifier/name made from property `[A:(a)]`. 
---
``` 
po ezaige ke gi be 
``` 
__ke__ is a pair with the left component being the identifier made from 
property __ezaige__ (it's common to define a predicate using itself as the 
identifier) 
``` 
ma 
  vi ke kin  
    va ezaige ezaige 
``` 

And with right component __gi__. 
``` 
    fo gi
``` 
__gi__ being a property (even if it's false for all possible arguments)
``` 
    fi vare 
      vie gi mai 
      fie bi gi mai 
```
