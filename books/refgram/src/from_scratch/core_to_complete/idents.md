# Identifiers

Identifiers are the names themselves. Each of them has its own atom which can be
referenced by `zai <pred>`. Since each name also corresponds to a property, we
can define this concept using a pair. In this pair, the left component is an
atom representing the concept of identifiers and the right component is the
property.

<spoiler>

__[ezaige]:__ `[E:ma]` is an identifier/name made from property `[A:(a)]`. 
---
``` 
po ezaige ke gi be 
``` 
__ke__ is a pair with the left component being the identifier made from 
property __ezaige__ (it's common to define a predicate using itself as the 
identifier) 
``` 
ma 
  vi ke kin  
    va ezaige ezaige 
``` 

And with right component __gi__. 
``` 
    fo gi
``` 
__gi__ being a property (even if it's false for all possible arguments)
``` 
    fi vare 
      vie gi mai 
      fie bi gi mai 
```
