# Pairs

An important building block is the ability to construct more complex
objects from simple ones. For that we define the concept of a pair, which is an
atom that is associated with a left and right component. We'll use an axiom to
state that there exist an unique atom for every possible pair of left and right
components.

<spoiler>

__kin:__ `[E:ma]` is a pair made of left component `[A:a]` and right component `[O:o]`. 
---
``` 
pou e kin pi be 
ma 
  vi boi kin 
```

__kin__ doesn't care about the context

```
  fi ke ka ko be varu
    vie ke kin
      va ka fo ko vei
    fia mae mua ke kin
      va ka fo ko vei
    vei
```

For every left and right components __ka__ and __ko__ 

``` 
  fi mae 
    ve ka be mae  
      ve ko be 
``` 

There exist an atom __ki__ which is a pair of __ka__ and __ko__. 

``` 
      ma 
       vi ki be ki ma kin  
         va ka 
         fo ko 
``` 

And it is false that there exist a different atom than __ki__ which is also a 
pair of __ka__ and __ko__ (thus there is a unique symbol for each pair) 

``` 
         fi bi ma 
           ve bi ki 
           fe kin 
             va ka 
             fo ko 
``` 
</spoiler>

By convention we'll prefer nesting pairs only in the right component.

Pairs can be used with left atom component specific to a concept A to make
it distinct from object related to concept B that would share the same kind
of objects. Without the left atom used as an identifier some things related
to concept A might also be considered valid things of concept B while it might
not be wanted. Identifiers are often made using __zai__ which will be defined
in the next chapter, and are defined themselves using pairs.
