# Morphology

The morphology of Eberban is composed of 16 consonants (__n, r, l, m, p, b, f, v, t, d, s, z, c, j,
g, k__), five vowels (__i, e, a, o, u__) the letter __h__, the hyphen __-__ and the quotation marks
__[__ and __]__, for a total of 24 symbols. Among the consonants, __n__, __r__ and __l__ are
designated as (alveolar) __sonorants__, and play an important role in Eberban's morphology. The
alphabetical order is `hnrlmpbfvtdszcjkgieaou`. The same letter appearing multiple times in a row is
considered identical to the letter not being repeated, but can informally be used in written media
to convey length of sounds in speech. Any other character is considered a space, and quotation marks
are also considered a space outside of foreign quotes syntax (explained later).

Strings of multiple vowels and __h__ appear a lot in Eberban's morphology, and thus are coined
__vhowels__ in this book. Note that in __vhowels__, __h__ can only appear between two vowels.

Words are usually written separated by spaces, however this is not mandatory. Spaces are only
mandatory before words starting with a __vowel__ or a __sonorant__.

Eberban text is usually written all lowercase (outside of foreign text quotes), but uppercase can
informally be used in written media to convey volume (such as yelling). No punctuation symbol is
used but informally punctuation from other languages can be used as long as the proper Eberban
grammar is also used. `.` is commonly used to visually join two words that must have space between
them, while one or many `.` surrounded by spaces usually convey a longer pause in speach. Hyphen can
be used at syllable boundary to make them stand-out without breaking the word in two, and also allows
a word to continue on the next line.

## Word types

### Particles

__Particles__ are words exerting grammatical functions. They can either:
- start with a single _non-sonorant consonant_, followed only by _vhowels_, like __zi__,
  __mio__ or __tiho__.
- start with a _sonorant_ or _vowels_, and be a string of _vhowels_ and _sonorants_. They can end
  either with a _vowel_ or _sonorant_. Exemples: __a__, __ol__, __ahu__ or __nu__.

Particles are themselves categorized into __families__ having identical grammar
but different meanings. Those families are usually designated using a particle in capital letters
(like __MI__ or __VEI__), which is by convention the first particle in this family in alphabetical
order.

All other words are __predicate words__ and express intrinsic meanings, such as "cat", "language" or
"teach". They are grouped into the following categories :

### Roots

__Roots__ are the building blocks of the language and express meanings that would be hard or too
long to convey otherwise. They can either:

- start with a single _non-sonorant consonant_ followed by a mix of _vhowels_ and at least one
  _sonorant_ or _medial consonant pair_, like __ban__, __mana__, __cuina__ or __marne__.
- start with a valid _initial consonant pair_ followed by a mix of _vhowels_ and any number of
  _sonorants_ or _medial consonant pairs_ (even none), like __bju__, __cpena__ or __djin__.

A _sonorant_ can appear only between two _vowels_ or at the end of the root, while a medial pair can
appear only between two _vowels_, but not at the end.

The following chart shows __initial pairs__ in light blue, __medial pairs__ in pink, and invalid
pairs in dark gray (with a short explanation for why they are invalid):

### Borrowings

__Borrowings__ allow importing foreign words or names. They are prefixed by the vowel __u__, and
have more relaxed rules about consonants than native Eberban words. Mainly, they can contain
consonant triplets which must obey the following rules:

 - Consonant pairs must either be _initial pairs_, _medial pairs_ or _sonorant_
   + _consonant_.
 - Consonant triplets C1C2C3 are valid if C1C2 is a medial pair __and__ C2C3 is an initial pair.
 - Alternatively, consonant triplets can be a _sonorant_ followed by an _initial pair_.

After the __u__  prefix the borrowing can start by a vowel, a single consonant, a initial or medial
consonant pair, a consonant triplet or __h__. If this first letter is a __u__ it must be prefixed
with a __'__ to separate it from the the prefix.

Borrowings must end with a _vowel_, or a _vowel_ followed by a single _consonant_ (not only
_sonorants_). In written media, borrowings must be followed by space(s), which is realized in speech
by pausing after the borrowing to properly separate it from the following word.

Similarly, the initial __u__ must be preceded by space(s), and realized orally as either a pause or
a glottal stop.

### Freeform variables

__Freeform variables__ allow defining predicates with a custom name. They follow the same morphology
as _borrowings_ but use the __i__ prefix instead of __u__.

### Compounds

__Compounds__ allow making new words from multiple other kind of words. They start with either
__e__, __en__ or __er__ and follow the same rule as the __u__ of borrowings. Their structure will be
detailed [later in this book](../grammar/compounds.md).

### Example

With spaces : _a za umia tsen eberban_\
Without spaces : _aza'umia'tsen'eberban_

Particles : _a_, _za_\
Borrowing : _umia_\
Freeform variable: _ibar_\
Root : _tsen_\
Compounds : _eberban_

### Reasoning

Outside of borrowings and assignable names, encountering a _non-sonorant consonant_ or a pause means
it is the end of a word; unless it the first letter of a _medial consonant pair_ which cannot be
misunderstood for the start of a new word. Spaces prevent words starting with a _vowel_ or
_sonorant_ to "merge" into the previous words.

These simple rules prevent any ambiguity of word boundaries, which is called a __Self-Segregating
Morphology__.
