At the start of a __vowel__ or __sonorant__ initial word, it is mandatory to
make a pause or utter a glottal stop \[ʔ\].

Consecutive vowels are separated by hiatuses, but glides like \[j\] and \[w\]
are allowed respectively alongside or instead of \[i\] and \[u\].

Where spaces are allowed, a speaker or writter can express hesitation by using
one or more of the letter __n__ surrounded by spaces, which is realized as \[n̩\].

In speech, the schwa sound \[ə\] can be used in between consonants of a pair if
the speaker has trouble uttering the pair as-is. It has no written equivalent.

Quotation marks __[__ and __]__, when used for foreign quotes grammar, are both realized
as a palatal click (\[ǂ\]) which distingly marks the start and end of a quote.
