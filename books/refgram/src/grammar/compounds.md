# Compounds (e-/a-/o-)

Providing a root for every concept would be extremely impractical and isn't
great for memorization. Complex concepts are often built upon multiple primitive
concepts, and compounds are used for this purpose.

Compounds allow the transformation of any string of valid Eberban words
(particles, roots and borrowings) into a single unit. While a compound
__ignores the grammatical rules of the individual words__, its meaning should
(to a certain extent) be related.

A compound is first prefixed by the letter __e, a, o__, respectively starting a
compound composed of two, three, or more words. O-compounds stop when a new
__o__ is encountered (with a space or word boundary marker before it). Spaces
can be inserted between any of the parts of the compound.

If the first word starts with a vowel (a borrowing) then the pause before this
vowel is optional.

Compounds have
__unique and fixed meanings which are defined in the dictionary__, and while the
definition of each one can be arbitrary, they usually provide arguments taken
from their individual components. Usually, the most important word is the
rightmost one, and additional words are added to the left to help narrow down
the meaning, yielding greater precision.

It is common to lexicalize a borrowing by making a compound with it. Cultural
concepts are borrowed with endonyms, sounding similar to the original word.

A compound follows the same __chaining behavior__ as its last/rightmost
component. If we want to define a compound with the opposite chaining behavior,
then the initial vowel should be followed by an __i__.

> __e ber ban :__ `[tca man] is the eberban language.`
> 
> - ber : `[E:tce* man] reflects this language (eberban).`
> - ban : `[E:tce* man] is a language.`

> __e uinglic ban :__ `[E:tca ban] is the english language.`
> 
> - uinglic : borrowing of "english".
> - ban : `[E:tce* man] is a language.`

> __a cen po bu :__ `[E:tce* ma] is a dictionary.`
>
> - cen : `E:tce* man`
> - po : Particle starting a definition.
> - bu : Particle creating lists.
