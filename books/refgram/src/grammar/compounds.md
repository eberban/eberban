# Compounds (e-)

Providing a root for every concept would be extremely impractical and isn't great for memorization.
Complex concepts are often built upon multiple primitive concepts, and compounds are used for this
purpose.

Compounds allow the transformation of any string of valid Eberban words (particles, roots and
borrowings) into a single unit. While a compound __ignores the grammatical rules of the individual
words__, its meaning should (to a certain extent) be related.

A compound start with either __e, en, er__, respectively starting a compound composed of two, three,
or more words. er-compounds stop when a single __e__ is encountered (with a space before it). Spaces
can be inserted between any parts of the compound.

If the first word starts with a vowel (a borrowing or __A/O__ particle) then the pause before this
vowel is optional. __NI__ particles needs to be prefixed by a pause or space to not be confused with
the __en__ start.

Compounds have __unique and fixed meanings which are defined in the dictionary__, and while the
definition of each one can be arbitrary, they usually provide arguments taken from their individual
components. Usually, the most important word is the rightmost one, and additional words are added to
the left to help narrow down the meaning, yielding greater precision.

It is common to lexicalize a borrowing by making a compound with it. Cultural concepts are borrowed
with endonyms, sounding similar to the original word.

A compound have the same __transitivity__ as its last/rightmost component (transitive/intransitive +
if that place is bounded with sharing/equivalence). If the compound transitivity should differ from
that component, an extra word is added in the compound among the followings:
- __se__: intransitive sharing
- __sa__: transitive sharing
- __sai__: transitive equivalence

Other particles that cannot be used directly as predicates are considered intransitive sharing.

> __e ber ban :__ `[tca man] is the eberban language.`
> 
> - ber : `[E:tce* man] reflects this language (eberban).`
> - ban : `[E:tce* man] is a language.`

> __e uinglic ban :__ `[E:tca ban] is the english language.`
> 
> - uinglic : borrowing of "english".
> - ban : `[E:tce* man] is a language.`

> __e glon sa :__ `[E:tce pan] plays game [A:tce* pan].`
>
> - glon : `[E:tce* man] is a game.`
> - sa: We're making a transitivite version of glon.
