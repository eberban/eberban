# Adverbs and prepositions (voi/foi)

__voi/foi__ can be used to attach a single predicate X as an adverb of another predicate Y. Y
will be evaluated by X (by binding Y to the A slot of X), however the predicate resulting from
the combination of adverb X and Y is a new predicate exposing all the slots of X. It means
explicit bounds or chaining of Y will interact with its slots, but will not be evaluated inside of
X.

This is very useful where X is a context-modifying predicate, as it avoids further bindings to be
affected by that context modification.

For exemple, with `sru` meaning `[A:()] will occur`, usage with and without __voi__ differs in
meaning:

- `mi etiansa (Y) voi sru (X) fa meon` = I will eat an apple (which exists now)
- `mi sru etiansa meon` = I will eat an apple (which will exist)

Any predicates present after the single predicate X form a chain C which will be sharing-bound to the E
slot of X. This allows to have preposition-like clauses.

For exemple, with `epaneski` meaning `Inside of [E:tce pan], [A:()] occurs` and `sru` meaning `[A:()]
occured`:

- `mi etiansa (Y) voi epaneski (X) spua fa meon sae duna (Y2) voi sru (X2) fa mo`: I eat in the house an apple that you gave
  me (you're not necessarily in the house)
- `spua epaneski mi etiansa meon sae duna voi sru fa mo`: In the house: I eat an apple that you gave me
  (you were in the house and that's where you gave the apple to me)

To instead perform equivalence binding (if E is a predicate slot), __vioi/fioi__ can be used.
