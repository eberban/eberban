# Numbers (TI/j-)

Numbers are important to communicate and serve many purposes. Eberban numbers
are expressed as a chain of __TI__ particles (any particles starting with _t-_),
which can optionally contain separators and a terminator starting with _j-_ to
make more advanced numbers.

## Digits

Numbers are mainly composed of digits (__TI__ family), which are chained one
after the other, starting from the highest significant one to the lowest, and is
by default expressed in base ten.

|     | -i | -e | -a | -o | -u  |
|:---:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---:|
| t-  | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |  4  |
| ti- |    | 5  | 6  | 7  |  8  |
| te- | 9  |    | A  | B  |  C  |
| ta- | D  | E  |    | F  | ... |

__te ta__ thus means __12__ while __tei ti tu__ means __904__.

While it is normally not allowed to use a digit higher than the base, it is
allowed if only one digit is used since there is no ambiguity over its value.
__teo__ is thus __B/11__, while __teo ti__ is not allowed in base ten.

## Number syntax

Numbers follow the following syntax:

(_base_ __ju__)? _integer-part_ (__jo__ _fractional-part_ (__ja__ _repeated-part_)?)? (__je__ _magnitude_)?

1. Optionaly the _base_ of the number can be expressed by a single __TI__
   followed by __ju__. This __TI__ is the last digit of the base used, thus
   __tei ju__ is base ten, __teo ju__ is base twelve, and __tao ju__ is
   hexadecimal.
2. The _integer part_ of the number, as a string of zero or more digits __TI__.
   If there are zero digits then a fractional part is mandatory.
3. This integer part can then optionally be followed by __jo__ and a _fractional
   part_ which is also a string of zero or more digits __TI__. __joi__ can be
   used instead to also make the number negative.
4. If there is a fractional part, it can be followed by __ja__ and a _repeated
   part_ which is also a string of at least one digit __TI__. The number has
   these digits repeated indefinitely.
5. Regardless of the presence of a fractional part, the number can then contain
   __je__ followed by a _magnitude_, which is a string of at least one digit
   __TI__. The value expressed is the previous part multiplied by
   \\(\text{base}^{\text{magnitude}}\\). __jei__ can be used instead to express
   a negative magnitude.

> Examples :
>
> - teo ju tie tia = \\(56_{12}\\)
> - tu ta = \\(42\\)
> - to jo te tu te tie tei = \\(3.14159\\)
> - to jo te ja to = \\(3.1\overline{3}\\), \\(3.1333\dots\\)
> - to jo ja to = \\(3.\overline{3}\\), \\(3.333\dots\\)
> - to joi = \\(-3\\)
> - tia jo ti ta ta je ta to = \\(6.022 \times 10^{23}\\)
> - tei jo te ti tei jei to te = \\(9.109 \times 10^{-31}\\)

## Various usage of numbers

Numbers have various usages which require different definitions and arguments.
The desired definition can be selected by ending the number with a particle of
family __JI__ (__jie__ is inferred if omitted). __jie__ is mandatory between
consecutive numbers to tell them apart. Particles other than __jie__ must be
non-zero positive integer (no fractional part).

- __ji__: `[E:tce* a] is (a group of) [number] things satisfying [A:(tca a)].`\
  Speaks about a set of expressed cardinality.
- __jia__: `[E:tce* a] is (a group of) [number] things satisfying [A:(a)].`\
  Same but uses the raw property variant of set definitions.
- __jio__: `[E:tcu a] is (a group of) the only [number] things satisfying [A:(tca a)].`\
  These are the only things that satisfy the property. There is nothing that
  satisfies A which is not in the set.
- __jioa__: `[E:tcu a] is (a group of) the only [number] things satisfying [A:(a)].`\
  Same but uses the raw property variant of set definitions.
- __jiu__: `[E:tca a] is the [number]th member of sequence [A:blu a].`\
  Speaks about an element in an ordered list.
- __jie__: `[E:tce gan] is the number [number] times [A:tce gan] (default: 1 unitless).`\
  `gan` is the word for a number, and both arguments are sets of numbers. These
  sets allow handling many numbers (ranges, approximations, or even arbitrarily
  constructed ones), and math operations are also defined using sets to
  distributively operate on each value of the set. The __A__ argument allows 
  multiplying this number with another number such as unit numbers ("1 meter",
  "1 kilogram", etc). The __A__ argument defaults to __1 unitless__.

Note that the _raw property of set definitions_ refers to the fact that sets
have two types of predicates: one where a member must satisfy argument `(a)` and
the other `(tca a)`. Many predicates expect their arguments to be sets, so the
latter is usually used. The former allows accessing raw members, an example use
case is dealing with nested sets.
