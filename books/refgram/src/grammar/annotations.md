# Annotations (d-)

Annotations are additional grammar that don't modify the logical meaning of the
text, and simply add notes or metadata. These annotations are also called "free"
prefixes and suffixes as they can be added freely before and after many elements
of the grammar.

## Paragraph marker DU

__DU__ can be placed before __PE/PA/PO/PU__ to mark a change of subject or
new paragraph. If __DU__ is not followed by one of them then __pa__ is implied.
If multiple prefixes in a row are used it must be the first of them.

## Free prefixes DI

__DI__ contains all particles starting with _di-_ and are prefixes to other
elements of the grammar. They currently contains particles related to "focus":

- __di__: Attention focus: the listener should be extra attentive to the
  following word. Maybe it would be especially prone to confusion? 
- __die__: Contrastive focus: It's that thing and not something else that was
  expected. 
- __dia__: Newsworthiness focus: Marks the part of the sentence containing the
  most important new information.

## Free interjection DE (suffix)

__DE__ contains all particles starting with _de-_ and is a suffix to other
elements of the grammar. It is followed by a single predicate which can be
prefixed by __SI/ZI__. However it doesn't support chains of predicates, unless
they are wrapped in __pe ... pei__.

__de__ uses this predicate as an interjection. Using a borrowing can be used
to make onomatopoeia, like `de uahaha` for laughter. Using a predicate word
could be compared to emojis or lojban's attitudinals, like `de gli` (love/❤️).

__dei__ uses this predicate as a metadata tag or _#hashtag_.

## Free parenthetical DA...DAI (suffix)

The families __DA__ and __DAI__ have single members __da__ and __dai__
respectively. __DA__ allows starting a parenthetical note which is ended by
__DAI__. This note can be any valid eberban text.
