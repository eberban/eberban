# Discourse predicates (MI)

Discourse predicates are additional __MI__ particles that don't wrap logical
primitives, but are instead part of __MI__ for historical reasons and are
related to the discourse.

__mi__ (intransitive) refers to one of the speaker(s) in speech, or narrator(s) in writen
media. 

__mio__ (intransitive) refers to a set of individuals which includes at least one of the
speakers and at least one of the listener(s)/interlocutor(s), and doesn't
include something that is neither a speaker or listener. It can be seen as an
__inclusive we__.

__mie__ (intransitive) on the other hand refers to a set of individuals which includes at least
one of the speakers and which can include anything that __is not__ the listener.
It can be seen as an __exclusive we__.
