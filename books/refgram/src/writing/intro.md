# Writing systems

As presented in the morphology chapter, Eberban can be written using the Latin
alphabet. However, there is also a custom writing system that takes advantage of
Eberban's morphology which is usable in a __linear form__ similar to how text is
written in the Latin alphabet, and in a __planar form__ which replaces argument
binding particles like __VI, FI or SI__ with graphical 2D notation.
