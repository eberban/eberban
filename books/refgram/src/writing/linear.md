The linear writing system is based on a central line called the __stem__ on
which vowel symbols are attached, while consonant symbols are added near it.
Symbols for consonants are organized in pairs of voiced and unvoiced consonants
which mirror each other relative to the stem.

To write text in this script, begin by writing a dot or circle with a vertical
line stemming down from it. The dot/circle disambiguates reading direction and
is also used to write word boundary markers.

Then the letters are written by following these steps:

1. If any, write the consonant symbol on the correct side, otherwise write a
   dot/circle if the word starts with a vowel.
2. If there is a second consonant, write it next next to the consonant, away
   from the stem.
3. Then write the vowel on the other side of the stem. If there is no prior
   consonant, the side can be arbitrarily chosen.
4. Finally, if the vowel is followed by a sonorant, write it next to the vowel,
   away from the stem.
5. Then: 
   - If the next letter is a consonant, return to step 1.
   - If the next letter is the initial vowel of the next word, write the
     dot/circle on the stem and go to step 3.
   - If the next letter is a vowel in the same word, move forward along the
   - stem and write the next vowel symbol on the __same side__ as the previous
     vowel.
   - If the next letter is an h, move forward along the stem and write the next
     vowel symbol on the __opposite side__ of the previous vowel.

Since the writing system uses symmetry to distinguish letters, it is important
to know if its support medium is mirrored or not (text written on glass readable
from both sides, text seen in a mirror, mirrored picture, etc). For this
purpose, it is recommended to write the __chirality symbol__ near the text.

The stem can twisted/change direction arbitrarily as long as the curves are
smooth and there is no self intersection.
