# Surrogate predicates [MA]

Surrogate predicates (**MA** family) are particles providing predicates about
the discourse itself. All particles starting with **m** are member of **MA**.

## Pronouns

Pronouns are expressed with the following particles :

| Word  | Definition                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mi    | ___ is me/the speaker/authors                                 |
| mo    | ___ is you listener                                           |
| miho  | ___ is me/the speaker/author & you the listener               |
| mihoi | ___ is me/the speaker/author & you the listener & others      |
| mihi  | ___ is me/the speaker/author & others but no you the listener |
| moha  | ___ is you (imperative), make it true for you, the listener   |
| mahi  | ___ is this here, near the speaker                            |
| maho  | ___ is that here, near the listener                           |
| mahu  | ___ is that younder, far from speaker and listener            |

## Variables / 3rd person pronouns

Particles starting with **mi-** are variables. They can be defined using `va`
and `lahe` (see chapters about **VA** and **LA** families for how to use them)
to have short words for a previously defined complex predicate. They can also be
used as 3rd person pronouns.

By default, they have an elliptical/contextual value. However, while being
elliptical *a variable always represents the same predicate/entity until it is
redefined*.

The current list is : mia, mie, mii, mio, miu, miaha, miahe, miahi, miaho,
miahu. This list can be extended if needed by following the pattern `"mi" +
vowel + h + vowel/diphthong`.

## Propositions

It is often useful to refer to other propositions. In the english sentences *"I
went to a party. It was fun."*, *"it"* represents the previous proposition *"I
went to a party"*. The following particles allow to express similar things :

| Word | Definition                                                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mua  | repeats the next to last proposition                                                             |
| mue  | repeats the last proposition                                                                     |
| mui  | repeats the proposition in which this one is embeded (used in abstractions)                      |
| muo  | repeats current proposition                                                                      |
| muu  | repeats the next (future) proposition (used to express first something about a future predicate) |

Counting takes only into account complete proposition, and ignore proposition
that are currently being defined when the word is used.

Using subscripts **PU** (explained in another chapter) allow to refer to more
distant predicates.

## Specials

| Word | Definition                                                                                               |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ma   | binds a variable within an abstraction that represents an open space (using in `ba` abstractions)        |
| me   | predicate question / fill the blank question.                                                            |
| mu   | elliptical/unspecified predicate, corresponds to the *null value*                                        |
| muha | when the content of a place is overwritten, it represents the previous content/value of the place        |
| muhe | binds to the relativized object of a relative clause (see predicate links **VA** and adverbials **fi***) |
| muhi | referers to the current topic (see prenex **foi**)                                                       |
