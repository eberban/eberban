# Surrogate predicates [MA]

Surrogate predicates (**MA** family) are particles providing predicates about
the discourse itself. All particles starting with **m** are member of **MA**.

## Pronouns

Pronouns are expressed with the following particles :

| Word | Definition                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| mi   | A is me/a speaker/author                         |
| mo   | A is you, a listener                             |
| moy  | A is someone, neither a speaker or listener      |
| mohi | A is this here, near a speaker                   |
| moho | A is that here, near a listener                  |
| mohu | A is that younder, far from speaker and listener |

## Variables / 3rd person pronouns

Particles starting with **mi-** are variables. They can be defined using `va`
and `lahe` (see chapters about **VA** and **LA** families for how to use them)
to have short words for a previously defined complex predicate. They can also be
used as 3rd person pronouns.

By default, they have an elliptical/contextual value. However, while being
elliptical *a variable always represents the same predicate/entity until it is
redefined*.

The current list is : mya, mye, myi, myo, myu. This list can be extended if
needed by following the pattern `"my" + vowel + h + ...`.

## Propositions

It is often useful to refer to other propositions. In the english sentences *"I
went to a party. It was fun."*, *"it"* represents the previous proposition *"I
went to a party"*. The following particles allow to express similar things :

| Word | Definition                                                                  |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mwa  | repeats a previous proposition (infered from context)                       |
| mwe  | repeats the last proposition                                                |
| mwi  | repeats the proposition in which this one is embeded (used in abstractions) |
| mwo  | repeats current proposition                                                 |
| mwu  | repeats a future proposition (infered from context, usually the next)       |

Counting takes only into account complete proposition, and ignore proposition
that are currently being defined when the word is used.

Using subscripts **ja** (explained in another chapter) allow to refer to more distant predicates.

## Specials

| Word | Definition                                                                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ma   | binds a variable within an abstraction that represents an open space (using in `pe` abstractions) |
| may  | binds to the relativized object of a relative clause                                              |
| me   | predicate question / fill the blank question.                                                     |
| mey  | referers to the current topic (see prenex **PO**)                                                 |
| mu   | elliptical/unspecified predicate, corresponds to the *null value*                                 |
| muy  | when the content of a place is overwritten, it represents the previous content/value of the place |
