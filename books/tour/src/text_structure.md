# Text structure [PA/PO/PU]

## Propositions [PA + PAY]

**pe** indicates the start of a proposition, while **pey** indicates the end
of it. Both are elidable, meaning they can be removed if the text would not
be parsed differenly. **pe** is often only used to separate propositions,
while **pey** is more rarely used if something needs to be attached to a
proposition a posteriori.

## Prenex [PO + POY]

A prenex allows to provide predicates before giving the main predicate
of the propositon. They can be used for 2 things :

- Declare variables ahead.
- Provide a topic (**mey** will refer to the latest topic)

## Paragraphs, chapters, sections, ... [PU]

Propositions can be separated by any number of **pu** indicating a
change in subject. Multiple **pu** will indicate bigger changes, which
can be used to mark chapters or sections.
