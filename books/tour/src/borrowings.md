# Borrowings [XA]

Borrowings allow importing words from other languages which would be difficult
to translate and express using root words, such as proper names, names of
species and cultural concepts.

A borrowing starts with the particle **xa**, followed by the borrowed word, then
a mandatory pause. The borrowed word should be a phonetic retranscription in
the phonology and morphology of eberban. Incompatible chains of vowels, or
pauses between a term made of multiple foreign words, should be borrowed using
*h*. Incompatible chains of consonants should be borrowed using a buffer vowel,
such as *q*.

Their place structure is "A is a [word]". Having a generic place structure
makes comprehension easier to a listener/reader who might not be familiar with
the borrowed word.

**xay** is used to import foreign names, by having the place structure
"A is named [name]".
