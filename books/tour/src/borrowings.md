# Borrowings [ZA]

Borrowings allow importing words from other languages which would be difficult
to translate and express using root words, such as proper names, names of species and cultural concepts.

A borrowing starts with the particle **za**, followed by the borrowed word, then
a mandatory pause. The borrowed word should be a phonetic retranscription in
the phonology and morphology of eberban. Incompatible chains of vowels, or
pauses between a term made of multiple foreign words; should be borrowed using
*h*. Incompatible chains of consonants should be borrowed using a buffer vowel,
such as *y*. A word starting with *l/m/r* must be prefixed with another letter,
as they are forbidden at the begining of every word.

Their place structure is `___ is a [word]`. Having a generic place structure
makes comprehension easier to a listener/reader who might not be familiar with the borrowed word.

If a more complex place structure is needed, **zai** can be used instead.
In this case the borrowing can have an arbitrary place structure (to be inferred from context). It should
only be used when the listener/reader is assumed to know the original word.

> Phonetic retranscription is not mandatory. For example, borrowings can be
> used to provide cultural words about countries or languages, by
> providing their ISO 639-2 language code or ISO 3166 country code (with
> minor changes if not compatible with eberban morphology). There are no
> country/language roots (except for eberban itself), to help maintain some level of cultural neutrality.
