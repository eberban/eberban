# Discourse predicates

Discourse predicates are additional __MI__ particles that don't wrap logical
primitives, but are instead part of __MI__ for historical reasons and are
related to the discourse.

__mi__ refers to one of the speaker(s) in speech, or narrator(s) in writen media. 

__mio__ refers to a set of individuals which include at least one of the speakers
and at least one of the listener(s)/interlocutor(s), and doesn't include something
that is neither a speaker or listener. It can be seen as an __inclusive we__.

__mie__ on the other hand refers to a set of individuals which includes at least
of the speakers and which can include anything that __is not__ the speaker.
It can be seen as an __exclusive we__.
