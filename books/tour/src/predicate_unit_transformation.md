# Predicate modification [ZA]

A predicate can be prefixed with one or more **ZA** particle to modify its
meaning and place structure. It applies only to the predicate directly on its
right (no chaining). Used or filled places comes from the new place structure.
(to fill the previous place structure, use abstractor **PA**).
