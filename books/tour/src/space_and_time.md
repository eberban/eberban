# Space and time (t-)

By default, space and time informations are contextual, and must be provided
explicitly to narrow down the propositions.

All space and time roots starts with **t-**, and are organised in the following
categories :

| Prefix | Category                              | Prefix | Category                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| *ta-*  | Temporal directions                   | *tah-* | Spacial directions          |
| *tan-* | Temporal distances/intervals          | *tar-* | Spacial distances/intervals |
| *ten-* | Temporal contours                     | *ter-* | Spacial contours            |
| *ti-*  | Subjective temporal/spacial intervals | *tu-*  | Temporal/spacial questions  |

## Temporal directions (ta-)

Temporal directions specifies how 2 events are ordered in time.


| Root  | Meaning                                            |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| *tan* | `[___] is in the past of/before [___]`             |
| *tar* | `[___] is in the present of/concurrent with [___]` |
| *tal* | `[___] is in the future of/after [___]`            |

> Both places have a default value of "now/the present".

## Spacial directions (tah-)

Spacial directions specifies how 2 things are located related to each other.

| Root    | Meaning                                            |

## Temporal distance/interval (tan-)

Temporal distance specifies how far an event occurs (in the past or future) from
a reference point, which is the present by default.

Temporal intervals specifies the duration of an event compared to the duration
of a longer event, which is contextual by default.

| Root    | Meaning                                                               |

| *tanyr* | `[___] has a duration of ___ (number with time unit)`                 |

> The "time unit" of *tanyn/tanyr* can be either seconds/minutes/..., or another
> event used as reference to provide length in multiples of the reference.

## Spacial distance/interval (tar-)

Spacial distance specifies how far something (in any direction) from a reference
point, which is "here" by default.

Spacial intervals specifies the length of something compared to the length of
something bigger, which is contextual by default.
