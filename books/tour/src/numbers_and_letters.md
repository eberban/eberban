# Numbers and letters [TA/BQ]

The **TA** family (all particles except **tay**) represents digits or
concepts to express numbers. On the other hand, the **BQ** family represents
various letters.

Multiple **TA** and **BQ** can be chained together, and the final chain
acts as one predicate.

## Numbers

If the first word of the chain is a **TA**, the chain means :

```eng
A is the number [number] in dimension/cardinality/property [E] (default = unit)
```

The 2nd place allow to use a property as a dimension/cardinality. This is used
to do quantification : *5 in dimension (being an apple)* = *5 apples*.

Letters can be used to have numbers composed of multiple parts designated by the
suffix letter. The value interpretation of the chain is context dependent.

## Strings

If the first word of the chain is a **BQ**, the chain is a predicate about
something recognized by this sequence of letters. It could be a predicate chain (explaned later)
with these initials, or a contextual predicate associated with these letters.

The meaning is thus ambiguous, and disambiguation might be necessary.

## Elidible terminator

Both types of chains (numbers and strings) can be terminated with the word **tay**, which is often elidable.
In fact, it is only needed to separate 2 adjacent chains that **should not** merge into a single one.
