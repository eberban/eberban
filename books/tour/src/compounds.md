# Compounds [C]

Providing a root for every concept would be extremely impractical.
Complex concepts are often built upon multiple more primitive concepts, and compounds
are used for this purpose.

Compounds allow transforming any string of valid eberban words into a single
unit, ignoring their grammatical rules but keeping (to a certain extent) their meaning.

A compound is first prefixed by the particles *a, e, i, o*, respectively
starting a compound composed of 1, 2, 3 or 4 words. If a compound is made of more than
4 words, it must be prefixed by *u* and suffixed with `'u`.

Spaces are forbidden between the components of the compound.

A compound has a unique, fixed meaning which is defined in the dictionary, and
while its place structure can be arbitrary, it usually provides places taken
from its individual components. Usually the most important word is the rightmost one,
and additional words are added to the left to help narrow down the meaning, yielding greater precision.

1-word compounds are also used to make predicate words corresponding to the
rule of a particle.
