# Free modifiers

Free modifiers allow to add information to almost anything. Modifier attached to
grammatical starters or terminators apply to the whole object they define.

## Subscript [JA]

**ja** attaches a number or letter string to a word. It can be used to be more
precise when using a vague particle, or to count higher than what is provided in
the language for variables.

## Discursive [JE]

**je** attaches a predicate (without chaining) to the previous word to make a
discursive, for example to provide emotions. To provide more complex predicates
such as chains and filled place, use **pa** abstractor.

## Suffix markers [JI]

| Word   | Meaning                                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *ji*   | Ask if the proposition is true, with emphasis placed on the marked word.       |
| *jiha* | Indirect question marker. Transform a question word into an indirect question. |
| *jihe* | Imperative. The tagged predicate should make it true.                          |
| *jya*  | However/but/in contrast.                                                       |
| *jye*  | Ditto.                                                                         |
| *jyi*  | Similarly.                                                                     |
| *jyo*  | Additionally.                                                                  |
| *jyu*  | Uniquely/only/ solely.                                                         |

## Parenthetical note [JO]

**jo** and it's terminator **joy** allow to add a parenthetical note. This note
can be any valid eberban text.

## Prefix markers [JU]

| Word  | Meaning                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *jwa* | Emphasis indicator : the next word is especially emphasized.                   |
| *jwe* | Rebind the following variable, discarding its previous value.                  |
| *jwi* | Nonce-word indicator : the next word (usually a compound) may be non-standard. |
| *jwo* | Next word is a metadata tag / hashtag.                                         |

*ju* is a bit special. It starts a "free scope" which is closed by the free
suffix *juy*. Any free modifier attached to either *ju* or *juy* will apply on
the scope they represents instead of only the adjacent words, allowing to add
information to a group of word even if they don't make a single grammatical
unit.
