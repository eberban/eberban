# Free modifiers

Free modifiers allow to add information to almost anything. Modifier attached
to grammatical starters or terminators apply to the whole object they define.

## Prefix markers [PA]

| Word   | Meaning                                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *paha* | Emphasis indicator : the next word is especially emphasized.                   |
| *pahe* | Rebind the following variable, discarding its previous value.                  |
| *pahi* | Nonce-word indicator : the next word (usually a compound) may be non-standard. |
| *paho* | Next word is a metadata tag / hashtag.                                         |

*pa* is a bit special. It starts a "free scope" which is closed by the free
suffix *pai*. Any free modifier attached to either *pa* or *pai* will apply on
the scope they represents instead of only the adjacent words, allowing to
add information to a group of word even if they don't make a single grammatical
unit.

## Discursive [PE]

**pe** attaches a predicate (without chaining) to the previous word to make a
discursive, for example to provide emotions. To provide more complex predicates
such as chains and filled place, use **ba** abstractor.

## Suffix markers [PI]

| Word   | Meaning                                                                                |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *pina* | True/false question marker. Ask specificaly if marked word makes the proposition true. |
| *pine* | Indirect question marker. Transform a question word into an indirect question.         |
| *pira* | However/but/in contrast.                                                               |

Additionaly, the *piha/pihe/pihi/piho/pihu* markers are variables which can be binded to a
word using *pahe*. Using them again (without binding) on something will refer back to the binded
word. It can be use to provide a more precise emphasis, for example related to an emotion.

## Parenthetical note [PO]

**po** and it's terminator **poi** allow to add a parenthetical note. This note can be any valid
eberban text.

## Subscript [PU]

**pu** attaches a number or letter string to a word. It can be used to be more precise when using
a vague particle, or to count higher than what is provided in the language for variables.
