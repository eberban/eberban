# Morphology

The morphology of eberban is quite simple. In terms of letters, there are 6
vowels (**a, e, i, o, u, y**), 17 consonants (**b, c, d, f, g, j, k, l, m, n, p,
r, s, t, v, x, z**), and a semi-consonant **h**, for a total of 24 letters.
There is also one symbol denoting a pause in speech, namely the apostrophe
**'**, which is optional in written media as long as there are spaces alongside
it. Among the consonants, three special ones are designated
(alveolar) **sonorants** (**l, n, r**).

## Letter conventions

While discussing letters, the following conventions are used:
1. A vowel tail, represented as __V__, denotes any chain of vowels or diphthongs
   separated by **h** or a sonorant.
2. A __C__ denotes exactly one consonant (including sonorants).

## Words

Letters may be combined to form _words_. There are two main types of words:
_particles_ and _roots_. Particles exert grammatical functions, while roots
denote concepts with an intrinsic meaning, such as "cat", "language" or "teach".
There is also a third type of words called _borrowings_, which can be used to
import words from external languages such as English; but you don't need to
worry about it for now, as this will only be covered later.

<!-- TODO: maybe add that pairs of consonants have some restrictions, but that we'll not go into details yet; could be another "advanced section", maybe? -->

__Remark:__ If you are familiar with Lojban, you may view particles as analogous
to cmavo, and roots as analogous to gismu.

Particles always follow the pattern __V__ or the pattern __CV__. In particular,
they always have exactly zero or one consonants and one or more vowels and/or
apostrophes. On the
other hand, roots always follow either the pattern __VC__, __CVC__, __CCV__
or __CCVC__.
<!--In particular, they always have exactly two consonants and one or more vowels and/or apostrophes.-->

Particles and roots starting with a vowel or a sonorant are technically preceded by a
pause `'`, which may be omitted in writing if there are spaces alongside it. 
They may never end with a non-sonorant.

Borrowings have the same starting rules, but may end in any letter, always
followed by a pause.

In written media, a sequence of words is typically, but not necessarily,
separated by spaces (" ").

>  segmenting to work with borrowings as well.

## Compounds
In addition to words, eberban also has the concept of compounds. Think of them
as some kind of "super words", which combine several words to yield a more
precise meaning, hence increasing the expressive power of the language.
<!-- is it fair to say the that a compound _narrows_ the meaning of the (last) word? I
guess not, as the last word could be somewhat figurative, as happens in some
lujvo --> If you are familiar with lojban, you might find compound vaguely
similar to lujvo, and to a lesser extent tanru. They always start with a vowel.
All in all, an eberbanic text is actually a sequence of words and compounds.
