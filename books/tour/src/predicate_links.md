# Predicate links [VA]

After predicate chaining is performed to form a new predicate, it's possible to
link other predicates (with chaining) with it with **VA** particles. This
link is terminated by **vai** which is often elidible. It cannot be elided if
it's followed by another **VA** which is linked on the same predicate, as
without **vai** it would link to the predicate inside the previous **VA**.
