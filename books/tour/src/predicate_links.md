# Predicate links [CA]

After predicate chaining is performed to form a new predicate, it's possible to
link other predicates (with chaining) with it with **CA** particles. This
link is terminated by **cai** which is often elidible. It cannot be elided if
it's followed by another **CA** which is linked on the same predicate, as
without **cai** it would link to the predicate inside the previous **CA**.
