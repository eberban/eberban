# Intrinsic variables (MA)

Intrinsic variables (**MA** family) are particles providing predicates about the
discourse itself. All particles starting with **m** are member of **MA**.

### Pronouns

Pronouns are expressed with the following particles :

| Word | Definition                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| mi   | Ⓐ is I/a speaker/author                          |
| mo   | Ⓐ is you, a listener                             |
| moy  | Ⓐ is someone, neither a speaker or listener      |
| mohi | Ⓐ is this here, near a speaker                   |
| moho | Ⓐ is that here, near a listener                  |
| mohu | Ⓐ is that younder, far from speaker and listener |

## Propositions

It is often useful to refer to other propositions.

| Word | Definition                                                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mwa  | a previous proposition (infered from context)                       |
| mwe  | the last proposition                                                |
| mwi  | the proposition in which this one is embeded (used in abstractions) |
| mwo  | current proposition                                                 |
| mwu  | a future proposition (infered from context, usually the next)       |

Counting takes only into account complete proposition, and ignore proposition
that are currently being defined when the word is used.

Using [subscripts **JA**](../struct/free.md#ja) allow to refer to more distant
predicates.

> These predicates are 0-ary. To refer to previous predicates with their places,

## Specials

| Word | Definition                                                                                                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ma   | binds a variable within an abstraction that represents an open space (used in [`PE` scopes)](../struct/PA_PI_PU_BA.md#proposition-pa--pay) |
| may  | binds to the relativized object of a relative clause (used in [`FA` scopes](../bindings/VA_FA.md))                                         |
| me   | individuals question / fill the blank question / Ⓐ is what ?.                                                                              |
| mey  | predicate question / fill the blank question                                                                                               |
