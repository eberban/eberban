# Extrinsic variables (KA/KAY/GA/GAY)

The **KA** and **GA** families contains particles that can be assigned using the
associated **KAY** and **GAY**, and used anywhere in the following text.

All members of the **KA** family (any particle starting with **k**) will bind
with an "individual" variable of the second-order logic. Members of the **GA**
family (any particle starting with **g**) however will bind with a predicate
variable.

**KA** can thus be used to refer back to common individuals similarly to
pronouns, while **GA** can allow to define a complex predicate that can be used
multiple times afterward.

Every **KAY/GAY** particle represents the same variable as the one without
**-y** (in **KA/GA**). The **-y** variant discards the previous variable and
create a new independant one, while the variant without **-y** will keep the
same variable. This allow to provide more informations using the same variable
in multiple sentences, and reuse it for something else when the previous bind is
no longer needed.

A **GAY** will only declare that there exist a predicate such that the statement
is true. However a more useful usage is to bind it to another predicate unit
using **po**, this **GAY** now being an alias of it. **po** can be used before
or after a unit as long as there is at least one **GAY** on one side : `GAY po
<unit>` or `<unit> po GAY`.
