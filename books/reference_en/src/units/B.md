# Borrowings (B)

Borrowings allow importing words from other languages which would be difficult
to translate and express using root words, such as proper names, names of
species and cultural concepts.

A borrowing starts with the letter **u**, followed by the borrowed word. The
borrowed word should be a phonetic retranscription in the phonology and
morphology of eberban. Incompatible chains of vowels should be borrowed using a
buffer letter such as *h*. Incompatible chains of consonants should be borrowed
using a buffer vowel such as *i*. If the borrowed word starts with **u** then
the prefix is **u'** instead of **u**. The borrowed word must end with a vowel
which can be followed by a single sonorant.

A chain of multiple borrowings will count as only one predicate unit composed of
multiple parts. To prevent 2 borrowings to form only one predicate unit,
separate them with **be**.

Their place structure is `(A) is a [word]`. Having a generic place structure
makes comprehension easier to a listener/reader who might not be familiar with
the borrowed word.
