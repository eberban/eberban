# Propositional logic

A **proposition** or **statement** is anything that has a **truth value** :
which can be **true** or **false**.

> A cat drinks milk.

This is a proposition, as it can be either true or false. 

Compound propositions can be made by connecting propositions with logicial
connectives, such as AND (\\(\wedge\\)) or OR (\\(\vee\\)).

> I go to the store AND the store is open.

This entire proposition is true only if both inner propositions are true.
