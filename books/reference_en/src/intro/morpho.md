# Morphology

The morphology of eberban is quite simple. In terms of letters, there are 6
vowels (**a, e, i, o, u, q**), 17 consonants (**b, c, d, f, g, j, k, l, m, n, p,
r, s, t, v, x, z**), 2 semi-vowels **w** and **y** and a semi-consonant **h**,
for a total of 26 letters. There is also one symbol denoting a pause in speech,
namely the apostrophe **'**, which is optional in written media as long as there
are spaces alongside it. Among the consonants, three special ones are designated
(alveolar) **sonorants** : **l, n, r**.

## Letter conventions

While discussing letters, the following conventions are used:
1. A **C** denotes exactly one consonant (including sonorants).
2. A vowel-tail, represented as **V**, denotes a chain of vowels separated by a
   semi-vowel, **h** or a sonorant (n, l, r). The first vowel can be preceded by
   a semi-vowel if it doesn't follow a consonant pair. **h** or sonorants can be
   preceded by **y**. A final **y** at the end of the word is also allowed.

## Words

Letters may be combined to form *words*. There are two main types of words:
*particles* and *roots*. Particles exert grammatical functions, while roots
denote concepts with an intrinsic meaning, such as "cat", "language" or "teach".
There are also 2 other types of words : *compounds* and *borrowings*. Compounds
are made from one or multiple particles or roots, while borrowings allows to
imports foreign words or names. They're the only 2 types of words that can start
with vowels, and must be preceded by a pause (**'** and/or space).

Particles always follow the pattern pattern **CV**. On the other hand, roots
always follow either the pattern **CVC**, **CCV** or **CCVC**. The final **C**
(if any) must be a sonorant. Borrowings may end in any letter, always followed
by a pause.

In written media, a sequence of words is typically, but not necessarily,
separated by spaces (" ").

>  involving sonorants ensure that, even if words (except borrowings) are strung

>  obnoxious &ndash; they are recommended, even. But in spoken form spaces
>  correspond to pauses, and this unique decomposition property suddenly becomes

>  every two words! For our fellow language nerds out there: this cool property
>  is also known as self-segmenting morphophonology :-)

>  Additionally, there is a mandatory pause at the end of borrowings, allowing
>  segmenting to work with borrowings as well.

## Permissible consonant pairs

Not all consonant pairs are allowed in eberban. The following table lists all
permissible consonant pairs.

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |        |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------ |
| cp  | ct  | ck  | cf  | cm  | cn  | cl  | cr     |
| sp  | st  | sk  | sf  | sm  | sn  | sl  | sr     |
| jb  | jd  | jg  | jv  | jm  | jn  | jl  | jr     |
| zb  | zd  | zg  | zv  | zm  | zn  | zl  | zr     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     | &nbsp; |
| pl  | pr  | tl  | tr  | kl  | kr  | fl  | fr     |
| bl  | br  | dl  | dr  | gl  | gr  | vl  | vr     |
| ml  | mr  |     |     |     |     |     |        |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     | &nbsp; |
| tc  | ts  | dj  | dz  |

## Permissible consonnant clusters in borrowings

Borrowings have more relaxed rules regarding allowed consonnant clusters.
A maximum of 3 consonnants in a row are allowed, and they can't all be
sonorants. A consonnant cannot be followed by the same one.

Consonnants are split into 2 categories called **voiced** (b, d, g, j, v, z)
and **unvoiced** (c, f, k, p, s, t, x). A **voiced** consonnant cannot be
followed by an **unvoiced** one, and vice-versa.

Additionnaly the following rules applies :

| Consonnant | Can't be followed by |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| j          | z                    |
| z          | j                    |
| s          | c                    |
| c          | s, x                 |
| x          | c, k, l, r           |
| k          | x                    |
