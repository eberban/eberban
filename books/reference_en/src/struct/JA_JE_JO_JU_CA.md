# Free modifiers (JA/JE/JO/JU/CA)

Free modifiers allow to add information to almost anything. Modifier attached to
grammatical starters or terminators apply to the whole object they define.

## Subscript [JA]

**ja** attaches a number or letter string to a word. It can be used to be more
precise when using a vague particle or use more variables.

## Discursive [JE]

**je** attaches a predicate (without chaining) to the previous word to make a
discursive, for example to provide emotions. To provide more complex predicates
such as chains and filled place, use [**PE** subscopes](PE.md).

## Parenthetical note [JO]

**jo** and it's terminator **joy** allow to add a parenthetical note. This note
can be any valid eberban text.

## Prefix markers [JU]

| Word | Meaning                                                                                                                                        |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| jwa  | Emphasis indicator : the next word is especially emphasized.                                                                                   |
| jwe  | Nonce-word indicator : the next word (usually a compound) may be non-standard.                                                                 |
| jwi  | Next word is a metadata tag / hashtag.                                                                                                         |
| ju   | Starts a *free scope* which is closed by the **free suffix juy (JUY)**. Any free modifier attached to either of them will apply to this scope. |

> **ju** and **juy** allows to attach information to a group of words which
> isn't a single grammatical unit for the grammar (hense "free" scope).
> 
> The parser currently doesn't check that each **ju** comes with its paired
> **juy**.
