# Predicate bindings

Each predicate unit has a **left chaining place** and a **right chaining
place**, which will define which of its variables will be bound with other
predicate units variables.

By default, both are the Ⓐ place. If a definition contains a place written in
brackets `[]` (thus called a "bracketed place"), this place becomes the **right
chaining place**. The families described in the following chapters allow to
override this default behavior.

When predicates are chained after each other, for each pair of consecutive
units, the left unit right chaining place will be bound to the right unit left
chaining place.

However, if the left unit right chaining place expects a predicate, it will be
bound the right unit itself. The parameters of this predicate arguments will be
Ⓐ, Ⓔ, ... in order.

If we look again this previous sentence :

> mi don spi mo  
> *I like to talk to you.*
>
> **mi:** Ⓐ is me/a speaker/author.  
> **don:** Ⓐ likes that Ⓔ (default: Ⓔ) satisfies property [Ⓘ1].  
> **spi:** Ⓐ talks to [Ⓔ] about subject Ⓘ0.  
> **mo:** Ⓐ is you, a listener.
>
> We first define each statement/predicate :

> \\[
> P_1 = \exists a_1 \\: \text{mi}(a_1) \\\\
> P_2 = \exists a_2 \exists e_2 \exists I_2 \\: \text{don}(a_2,e_2,I_2) \\\\
> P_3(a_3) = \exists e_3 \exists I_3 \\: \text{spi}(a_3,e_3,I_3) \\\\
> P_4 = \exists a_4 \\: \text{mo}(a_4)
> \\]

> Then we state that some variables are bound together (shared between

>
> - \\(\\color{green}{a}_1 = a_2\\), because *mi* has no brackets place.
> - \\(\\color{green}{I}_2 = P_3\\), because *don* has a `[Ⓘ1]`  predicate
>   place.
> - \\(\\color{green}{e}_3 = a_4\\), because *spi* has a `[Ⓔ]`  individual
>   place.
>
> Finally we express the complete statement :
>
> \\[
> P_1 \wedge P_2 \wedge P_4
> \\]
>
> \\(P_3\\) is not included as it's not a complete statement and is embeded
> inside \\(P_2\\).
