# Borrowings (B)

Borrowings allow importing words from other languages which would be difficult
to translate and express using root words, such as proper names, names of
species and cultural concepts.

A borrowing starts with the letter **u**, followed by the borrowed word, then
a mandatory pause. The borrowed word should be a phonetic retranscription in
the phonology and morphology of eberban. Incompatible chains of vowels should be
borrowed using a buffer letter such as *h*. Incompatible chains of consonants
should be borrowed using a buffer vowel such as *q*. If the borrowed word starts
with a vowel then the **u** is replaced with a **w**.

A chain of multiple borrowings will count as only one predicate unit composed
of multiple parts. To prevent 2 borrowings to form only one predicate unit,
separate them with **be**.

Their place structure is "â’¶ is a [word]". Having a generic place structure
makes comprehension easier to a listener/reader who might not be familiar with
the borrowed word.
