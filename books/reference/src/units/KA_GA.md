# Extrinsic variables (KA/GA)

The KA and GA families contains particles that can be assigned by the user
of eberban and used anywhere in the following text. The suffix **jwe** must
be used to mark that the previous value (if any) is overwritten.

All members of the KA family (any particle starting with *k*) will bind with
an "individual" variable of the second-order logic. Members of the GA family
(any particle starting with *g*) however will bind with a predicate variable.

KA can thus be used to refer back to common individuals similarly to pronouns,
while GA can allow to define a complex predicate that can be used multiple
times afterward.
