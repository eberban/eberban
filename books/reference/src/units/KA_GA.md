# Extrinsic variables (KA/GA)

The KA and GA families contains particles that can be assigned by the user
of eberban and used anywhere in the following text.

All members of the KA family (any particle starting with *k*) will bind with
an "individual" variable of the second-order logic. Members of the GA family
(any particle starting with *g*) however will bind with a predicate variable.

KA can thus be used to refer back to common individuals similarly to pronouns,
while GA can allow to define a complex predicate that can be used multiple
times afterward.

Every KA/GA particle ending with **-y** represents the same variable as the one
without **-y**. The **-y** variant discards the previous variable and create a
new independant one, while the variant with **-y** will keep the same variable.
This allow to provide more informations using the same variable in multiple
sentences.
