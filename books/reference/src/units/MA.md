# Intrinsic variables (MA)

Intrinsic variables (**MA** family) are particles providing predicates about
the discourse itself. All particles starting with **m** are member of **MA**.

### Pronouns

Pronouns are expressed with the following particles :

| Word | Definition                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| mi   | Ⓐ is I/a speaker/author                          |
| mo   | Ⓐ is you, a listener                             |
| moy  | Ⓐ is someone, neither a speaker or listener      |
| mohi | Ⓐ is this here, near a speaker                   |
| moho | Ⓐ is that here, near a listener                  |
| mohu | Ⓐ is that younder, far from speaker and listener |

## Propositions

It is often useful to refer to other propositions. In the english sentences *"I
went to a party. It was fun."*, *"it"* represents the previous proposition *"I
went to a party"*. The following particles allow to express similar things :

| Word | Definition                                                                  |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mwa  | repeats a previous proposition (infered from context)                       |
| mwe  | repeats the last proposition                                                |
| mwi  | repeats the proposition in which this one is embeded (used in abstractions) |
| mwo  | repeats current proposition                                                 |
| mwu  | repeats a future proposition (infered from context, usually the next)       |

Counting takes only into account complete proposition, and ignore proposition
that are currently being defined when the word is used.

Using subscripts **ja** (explained in another chapter) allow to refer to more distant predicates.

## Specials

| Word | Definition                                                                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ma   | binds a variable within an abstraction that represents an open space (using in `pe` abstractions) |
| may  | binds to the relativized object of a relative clause                                              |
| me   | individuals question / fill the blank question / Ⓐ is what ?.                                     |
| mey  | predicate question / fill the blank question                                                      |
