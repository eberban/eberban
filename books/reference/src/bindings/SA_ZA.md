# Unit transformations (SA/ZA)

## SA

**SA** allow to change which is the **left chaining place** of the following
predicate unit. **say** allows to ask which **SA** should be used to make the
proposition true. Other **SA** allow to use special variables that are related
to the predicate unit. If the predicate unit don't have a bracket place, the
**right chaining place** is also modified.

| say  | SA question : which tag would make the proposition true ? |
| sey  | something related to the predicate (vague transformation) |
| soy  | event of the predicate being true                         |

## ZA

**ZA** allow to change the place structure and/or meaning of the following
predicate unit. Any bindings will be made with the final place structure instead
of the original.

| zay  | ZA question : what transformation would make the proposition true ?             |
| ze   | Use the same instance and variables of the following unit instead of a new one. |
| zi   | Ⓐ is a predicate with places Ⓔ.                                                |
|      | *The following don't change the place structure but change the meaning:*        |
| zwa  | contrary scalar negator : other than .. (scale or set is implied)               |
| zwe  | polar opposite scalar negator : not a .. (no scale is implied)                  |
| zwi  | midpoint scalar negator : not really ..                                         |

> When using [**po** with a **GAY**](../units/KA_KAY_GA_GAY.md), **SA/ZA** must
> be placed before the unit itself : `GAY po ZA <unit>` or `ZA <unit> po GAY`.
> **SA** don't have any effect on **GAY** affectation, and will only affect the
> surroundng statement.
