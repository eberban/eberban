# Introduction

**eberban** is a [Lojban](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban)-inspired
[constructed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) aimed
at being simple, regular and expressive.

- Simple: eberban is made entirely out of predicates, which are manipulated with
  particles, following relatively few yet composable grammar rules.
- Regular: particles are organized into families, each with a unique prefix,
  enabling quick recognition and accelerating learning.
- Expressive: predicates can be combined and transformed in a variety of ways,
  greatly increasing the expressive power of the language.

This book will provide a detailed tour of the language, covering its concepts
and grammar.
