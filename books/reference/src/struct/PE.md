# Subscopes (PE)

When making complex sentences, the limitations around what
[**FA/VA**](../bindings/VA_FA.md) can do might pose problems. In these cases, it
is possible to use **PE** with its terminator **PEY** to create a subscope to
have access to all grammar available when making a proposition. **PE** and
**PEY** acts as some sort of opening and closing parenthesis.

**PEY** is ellidible if its at the end of a sentence (before **PA**).

A **PE** clause can only contain one complete proposition/predicate. However,
multiple statements with [logical connectives (DA)](./DA.md) are allowed.

> Subscopes makes sentences more complex to understand, and spliting it in
> mulitple simpler sentences might be easier to understand.
