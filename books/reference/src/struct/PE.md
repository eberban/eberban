# Subscopes (PE)

When making complex sentences, the limitations around what **FA/VA** can do
might pose problems. In these cases, it is possible to use **PE** with its
terminator **PEY** to create a subscope to have access to all grammar available
when making a proposition. **PE** and **PEY** acts as some sort of opening
and closing parenthesis.

**PEY** is ellidible if its at the end of a sentence (before **PA**).

> Subscopes makes sentences more complex to understand, and spliting it in
> mulitple simpler sentences might be easier to understand.
