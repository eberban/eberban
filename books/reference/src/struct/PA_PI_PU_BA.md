# Propositions and paragraphs (PA/PI/PU/BA)

## Proposition [PA + PAY]

**pa** indicates the start of a proposition, while **pay** indicates the end
of it. Both are elidable, meaning they can be removed if the text would not
be parsed differenly. **pa** is often only used to separate propositions,
while **pay** is more rarely used if something needs to be attached to a
proposition a posteriori.

## Predicate arguments [PI]

A predicate can be expressed by following **PA** with a list of
[**KAY/GAY**](../units/KA_KAY_GA_GAY.md) variables terminated by **pi**. Each
[**KAY/GAY**](../units/KA_KAY_GA_GAY.md) binds to the Ⓐ, Ⓔ, etc in
order.

## Paragraphs, sections, chapters, ... [PU]

Propositions can be separated by particles of **PU** family, indicating a
change in subject. While **pu** is a small change in subject and is analog to
a paragraph separator; **pwa**, **pwe**, **pwi**, **pwo**, **pwu** each express
an even greater change in subject, and can be used to separate subsections,
sections, chapters, parts, etc ...

## Proposition negation [BA]

A proposition can be stated to be false by using **ba** at the start of a
proposition (after **pi** if present).
