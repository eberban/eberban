# Parser version/dialect (BU)

The language is subject to change, meaning that a text could change meaning
or no longer be valid. Speakers could also choose to create dialects of the
language to experiment new ideas.

In order to more easily identify the version or dialect of the language, it
can be provided at the start of the text using **bu**, followed either by
[a borrowing](../units/B.md) (without u/w prefix),
[a number](../units/TA_BQ.md) (without **be**), or both in this order.

It is however not allowed in grammatical quotes. To quote eberban text of
other version or dialect, use [foreign quotes **XO**](../units/XA_XE_XO.md).
