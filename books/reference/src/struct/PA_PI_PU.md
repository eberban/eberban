# Propositions and paragraphs (PA/PI/PU)

## Proposition [PA + PAY]

**pa** indicates the start of a proposition, while **pay** indicates the end
of it. Both are elidable, meaning they can be removed if the text would not
be parsed differenly. **pa** is often only used to separate propositions,
while **pay** is more rarely used if something needs to be attached to a
proposition a posteriori.

## Predicate arguments [PI]

A predicate can be expressed by following **PA** with a list of **KA/GA**
variables terminated by **PI**. Each **KA/GA** binds to the Ⓐ, Ⓔ, etc in order.

## Paragraphs, chapters, sections, ... [PU]

Propositions can be separated by any number of **pu** indicating a
change in subject. Multiple **pu** will indicate bigger changes, which
can be used to mark chapters or sections.
