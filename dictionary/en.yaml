  short: "[E:ma] is an atom (grammar)"
  definition: 𝜆c 𝜆e is-atom(e)
  notes: |
    Simplest non-predicate type. All more complex non-predicate types are
    atoms that must additionally satisfy some properties.

    There are an infinite number of atoms which have no intrinsic meaning.
    Instead we can declare that they are connected in some way using
    definitions.

    Can also be used alone for tautology (always true), since there exist at
    least one atom.

  short: |
    Transform an [A:()] place into an [A:(p)] place, which is provided the
    content of the [E:p] place. The resulting predicate is transitive.
  notes: |
    While a SE before {i} can still override the chaining behavior, a SE after
    {zue} allow to select which places to use for the transformation.

    For 2-vowels SE variants "sXY", X select the entity place, while Y select
    the proposition place. Not using a SE thus is equivalent to an implicit
    {sea}.

    For 1-vowel SE variants "sY", it is equivalent to "SeY". Since it doesn't
    make sense to use the same places for both sides, {se} is nonsensical.

    The selected proposition place will be the one being transitioned to in
    chaining (unless overwritten by a SE placed before {zue}).

    In normal mode, intensity-aware predicates evaluates to true if the intensity is above a minimum

    for lower values, which is compensated by having access to that intensity directly. We can thus

    intensity (like vs dislike), etc.
