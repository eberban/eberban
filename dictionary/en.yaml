  definition: 𝜆c 𝜆e is-atom(e)
  notes: |
    Simplest non-predicate type. All more complex non-predicate types are
    atoms that must additionally satisfy some properties.

    There are an infinite number of atoms which have no intrinsic meaning.
    Instead we can declare that they are connected in some way using
    definitions.

    Can also be used alone for tautology (always true), since there exist at
    least one atom.

  short: |
    Instanciate the E predicate place of the prefixed predicate. Place can be
    selected by a following SI. This predicate is transitive.
  notes: |
    Is necessary to use a predicate stored in a KI variable (which have a
    [E:(...)] place) with arguments provided with VI/FI. It can however be
    used more broadly, for exemple with predicates that "transforms" a
    predicate into another one.

    Using a transitive GI variable can be seen as if it was some KI variable
    which was then instanciated with {zu KI}.
zui:

zue:
  id: qrpqjlbxo6
  family: "ZI"
  gloss: "#()-to-(a)"
  tags: [core]
  short: |
    Transform an [A:()] place into an [A:(p)] place, which is provided the
    content of the [E:p] place.\
    The resulting predicate is transitive.

    While a SE before {i} can still override the chaining behavior, a SE after
    {zue} allow to select which places to use for the transformation.

    For 2-vowels SE variants "sXY", X select the entity place, while Y select
    the proposition place. Not using a SE thus is equivalent to an implicit
    {sea}.

    For 1-vowel SE variants "sY", it is equivalent to "SeY". Since it doesn't
    make sense to use the same places for both sides, {se} is nonsensical.

    The selected proposition place will be the one being transitioned to in
    chaining (unless overwritten by a SE placed before {zue}).

bo:

  gloss: "#new-var-atom"
  short: "Create a new atom predicate variable and discard previous value if any."
  notes: |
    Creates a predicate stating the argument is some specific and fixed atom or
    generic value. The predicate thus have type (a).

    Using it before words other than KI make them behave like KI variables. It
    can thus be used to define freeform predicate variables (i-) to refer to
    an atom.
boi:
  id: aeguxusum3
  family: "BO"
  gloss: "#new-var-pred"
  short: "Create a new general predicate variable and discard previous value if any."
  notes: |
    This predicate can have arbitrary arguments, which will be constrainted by
    the rest of the sentence.

    When used before KI, have the same meaning as {bo} as all KI are expected
    to have type (a).
