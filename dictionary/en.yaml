  gloss: atom
  tags: [core]
  short: "[E:ma] is an atom (grammar)"
  definition: ùúÜc ùúÜe is-atom(e)
  notes: |
    Simplest non-predicate type. All more complex non-predicate types are
    atoms that must additionally satisfy some properties.

    There are an infinite number of atoms which have no intrinsic meaning.
    Instead we can declare that they are connected in some way using
    definitions.

    Can also be used alone for tautology (always true), since there exist at
    least one atom.

    Is necessary to use a predicate stored in a KI variable (which have a

    used more broadly, for exemple with predicates that "transforms" a
    predicate into another one.

  short: |
    Transform an [A:()] place into an [A:(p)] place, which is provided the
    content of the [E:p] place. The resulting predicate is transitive.
  notes: |
    While a SE before {i} can still override the chaining behavior, a SE after
    {zue} allow to select which places to use for the transformation.

    For 2-vowels SE variants "sXY", X select the entity place, while Y select
    the proposition place. Not using a SE thus is equivalent to an implicit
    {sea}.

    For 1-vowel SE variants "sY", it is equivalent to "SeY". Since it doesn't
    make sense to use the same places for both sides, {se} is nonsensical.

    The selected proposition place will be the one being transitioned to in
    chaining (unless overwritten by a SE placed before {zue}).

    an atom.

  notes: |
    See {jiune} for a similar predicate with a place for the number (which allows to ask questions

    To speak about the last member, use {blua} to reverse the order of the list.

    threashold of 1. In intensity mode, this threashold is absent and thus they may evaluate to true
    for lower values, which is compensated by having access to that intensity directly. We can thus
    customize the filter with another word to express new meanings: very, not much, negative
    intensity (like vs dislake), etc.

    If there are multiple intensity aware predicates, their intensity are averaged.
